<seg id="1">New Questions Over California Water Project</seg>
<seg id="2">Critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who's paying for a proposed $16 billion water project backed by Gov. Jerry Brown, after a leading California water district said Brown's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Critics said the government funding described by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District on Thursday could run counter to long-standing state assurances that various local water districts, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the Sacramento River south, mainly for Central and Southern California.</seg>
<seg id="4">The $248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels, which have yet to win regulatory approval, already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Wednesday, state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Thursday, state spokeswoman Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, no money from the state's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical Thursday, and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, one of the state lawmakers behind this week's audit order, asked the state Thursday for clarification.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's a shell game," said David Wolfe, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association's legislative director.</seg>
<seg id="9">I think it comes back to the audit (request) yesterday: There are way more questions here than there are answers.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tunnels project is endorsed by Brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in Central and Southern California.</seg>
<seg id="11">Supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer Californians a more secure water supply.</seg>
<seg id="12">Opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering native species there.</seg>
<seg id="13">Metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them, out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="14">The same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Thursday, a monthly report published by the LA-based water district on the tunnels project said, "the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources."</seg>
<seg id="16">After all that local water districts had spent on the project, including $63 million from his water district, "This is to be expected" that the state would use government money to close out planning, said Bob Muir, spokesman for the LA-based water district.</seg>
<seg id="17">He referred further questions to Vogel, the state spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="18">Vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing, half-century-old water network, the State Water Project.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tunnel opponents, however, point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation," said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="21">It raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Business Groups Appeal to China Over Cybersecurity Law</seg>
<seg id="2">A coalition of international business groups has appealed to China to change proposed cybersecurity rules they warn will harm trade and isolate the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">The letter to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, reflecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to China's market for information security products.</seg>
<seg id="4">Signers include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="5">The proposed rules would require providers to show Chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about Chinese citizens within the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latest letter, dated Wednesday, says that might make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tianjin chemical blast: Deadly disaster marked one year on</seg>
<seg id="2">Zhang Mengfan says the public deserves to know what happened in the Tianjin blasts</seg>
<seg id="3">China's leaders may want muted commemorations to mark the first anniversary of the massive chemical blast that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.</seg>
<seg id="4">John Sudworth reports from Tianjin.</seg>
<seg id="5">Almost anywhere else in the world the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would present a moment of national soul-searching.</seg>
<seg id="6">But not in China.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a memorial service to some of the dead firefighters is being held in the city of Tianjin, elsewhere the tributes are being muted.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Communist Party-controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survivors, as well as family members of the dead, are being warned not to speak to the foreign press.</seg>
<seg id="9">But 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan won't stay quiet.</seg>
<seg id="10">"On this anniversary there should be a way for the public to know what happened," he tells me.</seg>
<seg id="11">I don't want silence.</seg>
<seg id="12">On 12 August last year, Mr Zhang was a radio operator with a military fire brigade, stationed just a kilometre from the epicentre of the explosions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The call came in at 10:53 that night and we started to despatch my teammates," he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">It would have taken them 10 minutes to get to the scene.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other crews from elsewhere in the city were also arriving to tackle the large fire in a chemical storage depot.</seg>
<seg id="16">All of them would have been oblivious to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were being illegally stored, way beyond permitted amounts and without proper management.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fire had started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - had been allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat.</seg>
<seg id="18">It then spread to a huge stockpile - 800 tonnes - of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.</seg>
<seg id="19">The resulting explosions shattered the windows and brought the roof in at the fire station where Zhang Mengfan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those reports never came in.</seg>
<seg id="21">"When I saw the mushroom cloud I fell into a state of desperation," he tells me.</seg>
<seg id="22">I knew what it would mean for my friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Of the 26 firefighters sent to the blaze from his unit that night, eight never came back.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many of the others suffered serious burns and other injuries.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest of the two large explosions was measured as a seismic event, with a blast wave that was felt many kilometres away.</seg>
<seg id="26">The total cost of the damage was put at more than $1bn, including the 300-plus buildings that were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">A total of 173 people lost their lives - 104 of them firefighters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Eight bodies have never been found.</seg>
<seg id="29">An official government enquiry has laid the blame squarely at corruption, political connections and official collusion that allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden.</seg>
<seg id="30">The storage depot should never have been built so close to residential buildings in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 100 officials and company executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.</seg>
<seg id="32">So while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes repaired and the residents compensated - those lingering sensitivities remain.</seg>
<seg id="33">The disaster has exposed the cracks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of life.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bravery and sense of duty that night cannot be doubted and yet alongside the image of the firefighter as hero, there is the other uncomfortable picture.</seg>
<seg id="35">That of the firefighter as victim, sent without proper knowledge into an avoidable, man-made catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="36">Zhang Mengfan has now left the fire service but will attend the memorial service in Tianjin.</seg>
<seg id="37">He will be carrying in his heart a message for his dead comrades.</seg>
<seg id="38">What I want to tell them most is this: I've been to visit your parents and they are fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">Leave your parents to me.</seg>
<seg id="40">I am a member of your family now.</seg>
<seg id="41">I will fulfil your filial duty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cold spring could affect Scottish grouse shooting season</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's grouse shooting season will begin later, with cold weather hitting bird numbers this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several estates have postponed shooting as many of the early chicks did not survive the cool spring conditions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said grouse shooting sustained more jobs than the Edinburgh festivals.</seg>
<seg id="5">But animal protection charity OneKind called for an end to the "brutal slaughter" of the birds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The organisation's director Harry Huyton said: "The effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game birds for shooting is huge and invariably involves some extremely controversial practices."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not surprising the public is turning their back on this so-called sport and calling the government to account on a cruel, unnecessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small minority of people in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="8">But landowners insisted they were committed to conservation and that grouse shooting was vital to the rural economy.</seg>
<seg id="9">The SGA's chairman, Alex Hogg, said the industry supported 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and was a "rich seam of employment" in uncertain times.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said: "Compared to many other European countries, Scotland does not have an embedded 'hunting' culture and chunks of the population don't know the impact the shooting seasons have to the country, economically."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Hogg said the number of full-time jobs relying on shooting exceeded the posts created by the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe, Tattoo and Hogmanay combined.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added: "There are real concerns for employment in rural Scotland at the moment, particularly in oil and gas, so gamekeepers and their families want to see the industry grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to work with the Scottish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future.</seg>
<seg id="14">RSPB Scotland believes that eight golden eagles have been killed illegally around grouse moors</seg>
<seg id="15">Many gamekeepers acknowledge that grouse shooting is not universally popular, but the SGA said the industry had made "significant strides in terms of best practice."</seg>
<seg id="16">The opening day of the grouse shooting season is traditionally known as the "Glorious Twelfth."</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the sport remains controversial and the management of grouse shooting moors has been linked to the persecution of raptors by some wildlife bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said eight tagged golden eagles had disappeared in the Monadhliath mountains, south-east of Inverness, in less than five years.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wildlife charity believes they were killed illegally around grouse moors and their satellite tracking tags destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms Cunningham has ordered officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with the tags, to determine if there is a pattern of suspicious activity.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Scottish Moorland Group accused the RSPB of trying to whip up anti-shooting feelings ahead of the grouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the birds having even died in the Monadhliath area.</seg>

<seg id="2">Aaron McEneff netted two first-half penalties for the visitors at Finn Park</seg>
<seg id="3">Derry City have moved up to second in the Premier Division thanks to a thumping 5-0 derby win over Finn Harps.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aaron McEneff put the Candystripes in control with two first-half penalties, both given for fouls on Lukas Schubert.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nathan Boyle fired home early in the second half and Schubert hammered in the fourth before Keith Ward's late lob completed the Finn Park rout.</seg>
<seg id="6">Derry go a point ahead of Cork City and the teams meet at the Brandywell on Monday night in a crunch encounter.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was Derry's first win over their north-west rivals in three meetings this season and they were rarely troubled by a disappointing Harps side.</seg>
<seg id="8">McEneff tucked away the opener on 17 minutes after Ciaran Coll's challenge on Schubert, although the foul appeared to be outside the box.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no doubt the second spot-kick, with former Candystripes midfielder Barry Molloy bringing downing Schubert and McEneff making it 2-0 three minutes from the break.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boyle produced a clinical finish from a Dean Jarvis cut-back eight minutes after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="11">City keeper Gerard Doherty had a quiet night but he made a fine save to deny David Scully in the host's best opening of the game.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schubert flicked the ball past Coll before blasting in after 83 minutes and it was soon followed by Ward's clever chip over Harps stopper Richard Brush.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was Derry's biggest win of the campaign and perfect preparation for the showdown with Cork.</seg>

<seg id="1">Probe after mass failure of Inverness College UHI course</seg>
<seg id="2">An entire class of 20 students may have failed a Higher Media course run by Inverness College UHI.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of those on the course were 17 and 18-year-olds hoping to use their mark from their studies to go to university.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inverness College UHI said quality assurance processes were in place, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) was investigating.</seg>
<seg id="5">A spokesman for the SQA said the nationally-available 2016 Higher Media assessment had "performed as intended."</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty students signed up for the Inverness College UHI-run and marked course.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many of the students were young people in rural areas who received tuition online, but also had to make frequent visits to the college in Inverness from where they lived in places such as Lochaber.</seg>
<seg id="8">A father of one of the students said that, following postings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work, at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work.</seg>
<seg id="9">He told BBC News Scotland online that about five other people who sat the same course at Inverness College UHI last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="10">The situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of qualifications she gained at school.</seg>
<seg id="11">But her father said there were others who did the college-run media course who were less fortunate and were now "in limbo" and unsure if their course work would be re-examined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university places.</seg>
<seg id="12">Inverness College UHI is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.</seg>
<seg id="13">Diane Rawlinson, principal and chief executive at Inverness College UHI, said: "We take exam results and student success very seriously."</seg>
<seg id="14">This is evidenced by the excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year as well as the year-on-year improvements to attainment levels we have achieved in both Further and Higher education.</seg>
<seg id="15">As we do every year, we are undertaking a review of all published results, comparing them against those projected for each student.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the case of this particular course, the usual quality assurance processes were in place and the awarding body verifier recently reported 'significant strengths in the delivery and management of this award' and confirmed that 'assessment judgements were consistent with the national standards set'.</seg>
<seg id="17">SQA are currently investigating this matter at our request.</seg>
<seg id="18">A spokesman for the SQA said: "We are happy that the 2016 Higher Media assessment performed as intended and it provided candidates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many candidates performed strongly and we saw a slight increase in the A-C attainment rate compared to the same qualification last year.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was designed in line with past and exemplar papers and according to our course and assessment specifications.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jason Bryden was attacked with a samurai sword, knife and nunchucks</seg>
<seg id="3">Two brothers have been jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drugs-related robbery in East Ayrshire turned into a "bloodbath."</seg>
<seg id="4">The victim, Jason Bryden, 38, was repeatedly stabbed during the attack at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark, 36, was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder.</seg>
<seg id="6">His brother John, 38, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jailing both men, judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out "a merciless, relentless and savage attack."</seg>
<seg id="8">He rejected any suggestion that Mr Bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword.</seg>
<seg id="9">Judge Dunlop added: "You together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jason Bryden may have been a drug dealer but he was a son, a father and a friend.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was butchered by you.</seg>
<seg id="12">After both men were jailed, Det Insp David Moran, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible actions of John and James Clark caused the death of Jason Bryden."</seg>
<seg id="13">To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks.</seg>
<seg id="16">The sword used in the killing is believed to have belonged to the dead man.</seg>
<seg id="17">Neighbours said they could see the Clarks attacking Mr Bryden as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him screaming.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the trial: "This was a sustained, frenzied attack on this man."</seg>
<seg id="19">Afterwards, the scene of the killing was described as a "bloodbath."</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to the stab wounds, Mr Bryden suffered blunt force trauma during the assault.</seg>
<seg id="21">He died in Kilmarnock's Crosshouse Hospital three days later.</seg>
<seg id="22">Both brothers denied the killing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In evidence, James Clark, who has 38 previous convictions including one for attempted murder, said: "I didn't mean it. It was an accident."</seg>
<seg id="24">John Clark, who has 23 previous convictions, said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claimed was being attacked by Mr Bryden.</seg>

<seg id="2">David Sinclair admitted killing the child at his home in East Kilbride in 2012</seg>
<seg id="3">A man who shook and killed his baby son in a fit of rage because he would not feed has been jailed for seven years and three months.</seg>
<seg id="4">David Sinclair shook four-month-old Joshua in a "momentary loss of control" at their home in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on 6 December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cause of death was only discovered after a case review by medical experts.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sinclair, 34, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Bracadale told Sinclair: "You assaulted your baby son by shaking him, causing the injuries which killed him."</seg>
<seg id="8">You must have known at the time you had shaken him, but you did not disclose that.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was only after extensive medical investigations you admitted what you had done.</seg>
<seg id="10">Your wife believed in you.</seg>
<seg id="11">She now feels she had been misled by you and can no longer support you.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lord Bracadale described the effects of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" for all concerned and added: "Nothing can bring Joshua back."</seg>
<seg id="13">The court previously heard that that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his wife Kirsty had gone swimming with Joshua and then shopping in East Kilbride.</seg>
<seg id="14">At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded "shocked."</seg>
<seg id="16">He told her: "Joshua isn't breathing properly, come home right away."</seg>
<seg id="17">He then hung up and dialled 999.</seg>
<seg id="18">The infant was rushed to Hairmyres Hospital where he died.</seg>
<seg id="19">Initially the cause of Joshua's death was unascertained, but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally, close to the time of death.</seg>
<seg id="20">One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: "This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="21">Defending QC, Ian Duguid, told the court that Sinclair was "extremely remorseful" for his actions.</seg>

<seg id="2">GB's Tutton misses 200m breaststroke bronze</seg>
<seg id="3">Great Britain's Chloe Tutton appeared to criticise controversial swimmer Yulia Efimova's presence in Rio after the Russian finished ahead of her in the 200m breaststroke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Efimova, who was allowed to compete after appealing against a doping ban, took silver with Tutton fourth.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I would've preferred it to have been a completely clean Games," the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer said afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="6">I couldn't help who was here.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm not happy with it, but that's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="8">Efimova in second place didn't even know she was in the games until three days ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">I don't want to see people taken out of the sport, but I don't think that's quite right.</seg>
<seg id="10">She shouldn't have been in the race and a 20-year-old from Britain should have had a medal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal at Rio 2016 to beat Efimova into silver.</seg>
<seg id="12">China's Jinglin Shi won bronze, just six one-hundreths of a second ahead of fourth-placed Tutton.</seg>
<seg id="13">Her British team-mate Molly Renshaw, 20, finished sixth.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Being fourth is a bit gutting, no matter who is in front of you," Tutton added.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's a great experience and I'm a bit disappointed to come fourth.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm so close to a medal and that would have been a dream.</seg>
<seg id="17">But just to get into the final is a great experience that I'll take on with me for years to come.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was a bit gutting but it will make me tough in the long run and it just makes me more hungry for a medal so hopefully next time I'll get closer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tutton finished just 0.01 seconds outside the British record in the women's 200m breaststroke final</seg>
<seg id="20">'Everyone should have a second chance' - Efimova</seg>
<seg id="21">Efimova, who said she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to compete at Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">She was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has ruled that athletes cannot be banned from Rio on the basis that they have been previously sanctioned.</seg>

<seg id="1">Your delegation is pushy and rude</seg>
<seg id="2">India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, has been a conspicuous presence at Rio's Olympic Games, frequently spotted in the stands cheering on Indian athletes and taking selfies after their events.</seg>
<seg id="3">But he and his large entourage have apparently raised the ire of Olympic officials with unruly behavior, repeatedly trying to push their way into competition zones without the proper credentials and responding rudely when checked, the Press Trust of India reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vijay Goel, pictured in July, has defended his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to withdraw Goel's accreditation if the behavior did not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his entourage tried to enter restricted areas in the gymnastics venue and the arena where fencing and taekwondo is held.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have had multiple reports of your Minister for Sports trying to enter accredited areas at venues with unaccredited individuals," Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee wrote in the note.</seg>
<seg id="7">When the staff tried to explain that this is not allowed, they reported that the people with the Minister have become aggressive and rude and sometimes pushed past our staff.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Should our protocol team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavior, the accreditation of your Minister for Sports will be cancelled and his privileges at the Olympic Games withdrawn," the letter continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Indian delegation called the matter "a non-issue being made an issue" and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong, chalking it up to a "misunderstanding."</seg>
<seg id="10">He tweeted, "To my knowledge, we have been following all rules & regulations.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are committed to the spirit of Olympics & back our Indian players.</seg>
<seg id="12">Otherwise it's been a gloomy Olympics for India, with zero medals so far.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bummed-out fans on social media noted that Michael Phelps now has as many medals - 26 - as India has won in its history.</seg>
<seg id="14">Several prominent contenders have already been eliminated, including shooter Abhinav Bindra who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="15">He placed fourth this time.</seg>
<seg id="16">What a waste of money and opportunity," author and columnist Shobhaa De said in a sardonic tweet.</seg>
<seg id="17">But some bright hopes remain, with competitors foraging ahead in boxing, golf, tennis, track and field and, yes, badminton.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lone Indian woman gymnast, Dipa Karmakar, will compete in the vault finals on Sunday - showing off her fearsome double revolution "Vault of Death," the Produnova, attempted by few other gymnasts.</seg>
<seg id="19">For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low medal count has always been a source of consternation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Analysts say that there are myriad reasons for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">The national obsession is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="22">India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for Olympians - Karmakar's first vault was made from parts of an old scooter.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parents have historically emphasized academics over sport.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the sports' governing bodies have been dogged by corruption.</seg>
<seg id="25">The International Olympic Committee suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its charter in 2012 because they had elected leaders with pending criminal charges.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Sochi, India's three winter Olympians were not even allowed to compete for their country, carry the flag or wear the insignia.</seg>
<seg id="27">They competed as independents.</seg>

<seg id="1">DEA's missed opportunity on medical marijuana</seg>
<seg id="2">The answer sadly is: unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="3">And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Up until today, there has been only one federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana, at the University of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.</seg>
<seg id="7">While this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door.</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.</seg>
<seg id="10">Marijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is the predicament of medical marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="13">Potential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance, institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="17">This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, after years of bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock.</seg>
<seg id="20">Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.</seg>
<seg id="22">The problem, however, is that last word in its name: "abuse."</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine.</seg>
<seg id="24">Abrams makes an important point.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Consider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits.</seg>
<seg id="28">The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."</seg>
<seg id="29">That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture.</seg>
<seg id="30">The road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.</seg>
<seg id="31">While the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.</seg>
<seg id="33">In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.</seg>
<seg id="34">For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response.</seg>
<seg id="35">By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.</seg>
<seg id="36">Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.</seg>
<seg id="37">By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.</seg>
<seg id="38">Again, that was from a judge with the DEA itself.</seg>
<seg id="39">And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.</seg>
<seg id="40">Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives.</seg>
<seg id="41">Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.</seg>
<seg id="42">With regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi, whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="44">That a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump 'a blonde Berlusconi'</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bloody Beetroots is known for electronic dance music</seg>
<seg id="3">The musicians say Trump's dominance of the media is similar to Berlusconi's</seg>
<seg id="4">"You know, we used to have Berlusconi in Italy and to me, Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi," Rifo, who is the founder of electro-dance punk formation, The Bloody Beetroots, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Republican presidential nominee and the Italian media mogul turned politician are both known for their larger than life personalities, their skills in capturing the attention of the press and shaping narratives in the media.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the Bloody Beetroots, Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with artists from the legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bech in the 2013 song, "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."</seg>
<seg id="7">Rifo was born in the Italian town of Bessano del Grappa outside Venice in 1977, which is around the time punk rock was born, and the numbers "1977" are tattooed across the musician's chest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"English is not my main language so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said from behind a black mask, which he is known for.</seg>
<seg id="9">I try to explore and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rifo urged Americans to watch "Videocracy," a documentary which explores Berlusconi's monopoly over the Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="11">The documentary is about "how Berlusconi used to drive Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trump has had a similar effect on America.</seg>
<seg id="12">"You see the way a man can completely invert the system and curve everything ... for his wants," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump, to me, looks like something that is not good for this country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two Turkish sailors jailed over £500 million drugs bust</seg>
<seg id="2">Two Turkish men convicted of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea have each been jailed for at least 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after three tonnes of the Class A drug were discovered inside the MV Hamal about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 2015 seizure is said to be the biggest single cocaine haul ever recovered at sea in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen have been jailed for their role in a huge drug deal</seg>
<seg id="6">The massive haul of drugs found on the boat is one of the biggest in British history</seg>
<seg id="7">The drugs were found hidden in a specially-adapted secret hold in the Tanzanian-registered tugboat, which was sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was stopped by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and Border Force cutter HMC Valiant.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sahin, 47, was sentenced to 22 years while Ozmen, 51, was handed down a 20-year term at the High Court in Glasgow.</seg>
<seg id="10">Judge Lord Kinclaven told the men the quantity of drugs was 'not only significant but massive' and drugs trafficking had a 'devastating impact' on people and communities.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said: 'You were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale involving the transportation of cocaine by ship, in an operation which crossed international and indeed intercontinental boundaries.'</seg>
<seg id="12">He told the ship's captain Sahin, he was 'not at the top of the drugs tree' but had played an important role in the offence, while second captain Ozmen's role was 'to some extent a lesser one'.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officers boarded the Hamal following a tip-off from French customs body DNRED, and once it was docked in Aberdeen they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment to find 128 bales of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes, with an estimated street value of £512 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">MV Hamal was boarded by the Royal Navy last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Three tonnes of cocaine was onboard</seg>
<seg id="16">Tonnes of the Class-A drug were crammed in the ship's ballast tank when it was raided</seg>
<seg id="17">The ship went from the Bosporus to South America before being stopped in the North Sea</seg>
<seg id="18">The entry to the space was found under a wardrobe in one of the crew's quarters, with the opening cemented over.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of being concerned with the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between February 20 and April 23 last year, and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between April 21 and April 23.</seg>
<seg id="20">The men, both first offenders who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school, continue to maintain their innocence but accept the jury's verdict.</seg>
<seg id="21">Charges against four other men were found not proven.</seg>
<seg id="22">Sahin's lawyer, Jonathan Crowe, said the married father-of-two was a 'glorified mule'.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said: 'Someone who was involved in the transportation of the drugs.'</seg>
<seg id="24">Someone who was able to captain a boat.</seg>
<seg id="25">In regard to the drugs hierarchy, Mr Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drugs tree but somewhere further down.</seg>
<seg id="26">The sheer amount of cocaine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a crane</seg>
<seg id="27">Police spent days going through the boat before the drugs were divided into these boxes</seg>
<seg id="28">Sahin was approached about captaining the Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr Crowe said he is 'devastated' about missing out on milestones for his daughter, nine, and son, 13, and 'just wants to go home to Turkey'.</seg>
<seg id="30">Both men have not seen their families since being taken into custody in April 2015 as their families struggle to get visa approval.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ozmen's lawyer, Di Moore, said he is 'desperate' to see his family but knows that will 'remain impossible' for the foreseeable future.</seg>
<seg id="32">Speaking following today's sentencing, Scotland's Crown Agent prosecutor David Harvie said: 'The international drugs trade does not respect borders, and those of us whose job it is to dismantle it are working ever-closer together to ensure we stay one step ahead.</seg>
<seg id="33">'Scotland's reach in pursuing criminals is on a truly global scale and in this case we have dealt a substantial economic blow to organised criminals.'</seg>
<seg id="34">Drugs were packed into every cavity in the boat, including under the floors</seg>
<seg id="35">This package of contraband was found hidden in the ship's laundry room by officers</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr Harvie added:'The Hamal was identified after an intelligence tip-off from French authorities, and swift co-operation from the Attorney General in Tanzania where the ship was registered allowed it to be boarded.</seg>
<seg id="37">'Our investigation then stretched from Guyana, who provided access to crucial shipping records, to Spain, who gave us crucial information on the ship's stop-offs in the Canary Islands.</seg>
<seg id="38">We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to piece specific elements of the evidence together.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite strong intelligence that the Hamal was carrying a large volume of drugs, it could not be boarded in international waters by the UK authorities without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never previously granted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Sue Patten, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) International Justice and Organised Crime Division, said: 'Acting quickly and precisely, the CPS criminal justice adviser in Tanzania was able get permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the boat within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="41">Under international maritime law, the UK cannot board a vessel in international waters which is under the flag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without the swift actions of our criminal justice adviser, there was a high risk that the vessel may have escaped and we would never have been able to bring these men to justice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lancashire father banned from children's school after wearing T-shirt with swear word</seg>
<seg id="2">A father-of-two has been banned from his children's school for turning up at their sports day in an offensive T-shirt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley, in Lancashire, says he 'accidentally' wore the top with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it'.</seg>
<seg id="4">But despite apologising when he realised his error and turning the T-shirt inside out, the next day he discovered he was barred from the school grounds.</seg>
<seg id="5">The single father, who had been a governor for four years at Park Primary School, in Colne, Burnley, was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the police.</seg>
<seg id="6">Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley says he was barred from the school grounds after wearing this offensive T-shirt to his children's sports day</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Burnley has accused head teacher Sarah Midgely of overreacting.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he is being unfairly punished for mistakenly putting on the T-shirt in a rush before going to watch his two children compete.</seg>
<seg id="9">The dad, who has now quit as a school governor, said: "It was a mistake, and an oversight on my part.</seg>
<seg id="10">I was not thinking about sports day and rushing when I put it on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Towards the end of the event we were having a father's race and the head teacher noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="12">I apologised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the 36-year-old said he received an email from the chairman of governors later that evening asking him to meet with the head the next day, but he did not see the need after he had already apologised.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The headteacher then phoned me and said I was barred from the school premises," added Mr Burnley,</seg>
<seg id="15">I found out after the sports day some of the parents went on Facebook and made a fuss about it and that got a lot of people interested.</seg>
<seg id="16">Any right-minded person would think this was an overreaction.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr McBeth, who is the editor of an online magazine called Love Mini, said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of term, because of the ban.</seg>
<seg id="18">But this prompted a phone call from the school and social services.</seg>
<seg id="19">The t-shirt had a picture of Craig Charles's character Lister from the cult BBC comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic lines -'Let's go out and t**t it.'</seg>
<seg id="20">He commented: "I told them I was not there because they had banned me from the school.</seg>
<seg id="21">I then got a phone call from social services asking why I had not picked my daughter up.</seg>
<seg id="22">The school also called the police because I did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr McBeth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school premises and the prohibition will continue until further notice.</seg>
<seg id="24">He says he was also warned he could face a fine of £500 if found trespassing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said this matter is now closed</seg>
<seg id="26">Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr McBeth has resigned and is no longer a governor at our school.</seg>
<seg id="27">This matter is now closed and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in September.</seg>
<seg id="28">Burnley councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We all have to bear in mind when you take on these roles such as a councillor or governor you are held to a higher standard and unfortunately this time he has not met that standard," he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Councillor Jonathan Nixon added he did not think the school should have banned him and the situation had been blown out of proportion.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Nixon added: "He was stupid to wear the T-shirt and he apologised at the time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Lancashire Police confirmed they were called by the school, but did not attend.</seg>

<seg id="5">Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicenter in early 2014 of fierce riots protesting against Maduro's regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet now, when the opposition needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the referendum happens this year, people across the country are not showing the same energy.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security reasons," said Deyan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Others, more informed, are willing to mobilize in the future but admit Venezuelans are less motivated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Electoral board president Tibisay Lucena's comments prove that the government is hindering the recall process.</seg>
<seg id="10">I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are scared," Roberto Reyes, 60, told Fox News Latino.</seg>
<seg id="11">So on top to the many barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: motivating people to go out to the streets and protest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Until recently the referendum initiative had plenty of support - people moved in unprecedented numbers during the collection of signatures phase.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when it comes to protesting against the government's maneuvers to block the effort, turnout at rallies have been ostensibly low.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some people are focused in making food lines, while others are scared after the many arrests and deaths in 2014," said Cipriano Heredia, a lawmaker for the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="15">After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process - gather yet more signatures countrywide - would have to wait until October, those opposed to the socialist government claim President Maduro and his acolytes are just trying to discourage Venezuelans, making them believe that a vote this year is all but impossible.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a successor.</seg>
<seg id="17">If he were ousted this year, however, he is mandated to call for a general election.</seg>
<seg id="18">The U.S. Department of State addressed the issue in a statement Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The remaining steps for the realization of the Presidential Recall Referendum need to be pursued clearly, concretely and without delay, and thus contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country," it read.</seg>
<seg id="20">Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Board between 2006 and 2009, said change is not likely anytime soon.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I think that there will not be a referendum this year, unless the social unrest and protests grow much more," he told FNL.</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that in his view Lucena and the government are breaking the law, but they may ultimately achieve their goal if people don't protest loud enough.</seg>
<seg id="23">The opposition has called for a big rally on Sept. 1st in Caracas to demand a speed-up of the process so the recall can take place this year.</seg>
<seg id="24">We want people from all over the country to mobilize to the capital city on that day.</seg>
<seg id="25">The government will feel the pressure," Heredia said.</seg>
<seg id="26">But Salamanca thinks that the situation can't wait that long.</seg>
<seg id="27">"They should have a quicker and stronger response to Lucena's announcement because it practically kills the referendum," the expert told FNL.</seg>
<seg id="28">Congressman Heredia admitted that some parties inside the opposition are pushing to make the rally sooner, but other groups prefer to have more time to organize.</seg>
<seg id="29">The opposition has to be careful now.</seg>
<seg id="30">If people get discouraged by the situation there is a risk of low turnout in the second round of signature petition," said Salamanca.</seg>
<seg id="31">The referendum process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the country's electorate, close to 4 million people, in order to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="32">Salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place on 2017, Chavismo will be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="33">But some are not that optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="34">Our party wants political change this year.</seg>
<seg id="35">"If the government closes down the electoral path, we will have to explore other legal options," Heredia told FNL.</seg>

<seg id="1">Premier League 2016-17 previews No19 West Bromwich Albion</seg>
<seg id="2">Guardian writers" predicted position 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction but the average of our writers" tips)</seg>
<seg id="3">Last season's position 14th</seg>
<seg id="4">Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 1,000-1</seg>
<seg id="5">Until last week it looked like a case of new season, same old West Bromwich Albion: 2016-17 would be another campaign of comfort - or stagnation depending on how empty the glass is - under the ever-pragmatic Tony Pulis.</seg>
<seg id="6">But then Jeremy Peace sold his 88% stake in the club to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, the archetypal safe pair of hands, was immediately made the bookmakers" favourite in the ever unpleasant market of first manager to be fired.</seg>
<seg id="7">The landscape has undeniably altered in the Black Country - and not just at The Hawthorns, but a few miles north-west in Wolverhampton, too, where new Chinese owners wasted no time in relieving Kenny Jackett of his services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pulis, however, has been given reassurances by Lai that his job is not in immediate threat, and the entrepreneur has also stated his desire not to alter the club culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have no wish to change the club's ethos or embark on an unsustainable spending spree," he said upon taking over.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for the long term.</seg>
<seg id="11">First and foremost, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premier League and then beyond that, I would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the division.</seg>
<seg id="12">I believe it is the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="13">Such is Pulis's record, the first aspect should not be too problematic.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next aim is to break into the top half of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided fanbase hoping for a quick shoot up the table to realise that is an increasingly onerous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid-table sides.</seg>
<seg id="15">To progress from last season's 14th-place finish will certainly require more of an edge up front.</seg>
<seg id="16">Only Aston Villa, tailed off at the bottom, scored fewer goals and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion were averaging fewer than a shot on target per 90 minutes, by some stretch the division's worst.</seg>
<seg id="17">They failed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only nine occasions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of their 10 victories, not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-0.</seg>
<seg id="19">Predictably, a dozen of their sparse total of 34 came from set pieces.</seg>
<seg id="20">Little wonder disgruntled reactions were common at The Hawthorns, perhaps most notably after a diabolical 0-0 draw with Villa in late January, when the visitors looked the more likely.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the flip side, only the top six had better defensive records - though no other club could claim to regularly line up with four centre-halves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Those defenders are often underappreciated, not least Jonny Evans, who is said to have Arsenal chasing him following their latest injury crisis.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Northern Ireland international enjoyed a fine European Championship and it would take a hefty fee for Albion to sell.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ben Foster is dependable in goal and they are well stocked in midfield.</seg>
<seg id="25">Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 32, and Claudio Yacob is underrated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Irritatingly for all parties the long and winding tale of Saido Berahino's future remains unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bids from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected under Peace's ownership but the former remain keen and Mark Hughes is happy to be patient.</seg>
<seg id="28">After last season was close to a write-off, it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through.</seg>
<seg id="29">The striker is undoubtedly talented but with, as Pulis mentioned more than once, people dragging him one way and pulling him the other it has long been evident the relationship is unworkable.</seg>
<seg id="30">Albion are insistent upon signing a replacement before letting the former England Under-21 international go but their £15m move for Diafra Sakho broke down days before the takeover, with the club stating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="31">It places a lot of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomón Rondón, who showed brief flashes of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of nine goals, especially if Rickie Lambert continues to be as ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="32">The decision to release Victor Anichebe and Stéphane Sessègnon also looks odd in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="33">Pulis has been notoriously slow to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teenagers - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts - in the final game of last season, a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, is unlikely to become the norm.</seg>
<seg id="34">He will return to the tried and tested but Leko is worth keeping an eye on.</seg>
<seg id="35">The 17-year-old attacking midfielder made five appearances in total last season, becoming the first player born in 1999 to appear in the Premier League, and is also highly rated in the England underage system.</seg>
<seg id="36">Matt Phillips, a £5.5m signing from Queens Park Rangers, will provide pace but he is the sole new player entering the opening weekend of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a hectic one.</seg>
<seg id="38">"All over," Pulis told the Express and Star last month about where needs to be strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="39">Every position that you look at.</seg>
<seg id="40">The back players, midfield players and front players, we have to strengthen.</seg>
<seg id="41">The targets have been there, we know what we want.</seg>
<seg id="42">Getting them is proving more difficult than envisaged, mostly due to uncertainty during the takeover process.</seg>
<seg id="43">The season could be defined by how they start, with seven eminently winnable games before a daunting run of Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="44">By that point the pressure on Pulis will have eased or become insurmountable.</seg>
<seg id="45">And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tata Steel UK rescue deal closer after trustees back pension changes</seg>
<seg id="2">The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company.</seg>
<seg id="3">The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of £15bn and a deficit of as much as £700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support.</seg>
<seg id="7">Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to £300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control.</seg>
<seg id="9">Johnston said the trustees accepted it "would not be realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government.</seg>
<seg id="13">Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable."</seg>
<seg id="14">Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel's annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on," Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward.</seg>
<seg id="17">The pension trustees" willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel.</seg>
<seg id="18">The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.</seg>
<seg id="19">Johnston added: "The trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund.</seg>
<seg id="20">Our investment strategy has meant that the scheme's funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis.</seg>

<seg id="1">The custody business had achieved an average annual growth rate of 52.89% in the past six years, covering fund, insurance, trust, bank financial management, pension, cross-border investment, social welfare, transaction payment and many other sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Huang Runzhong, head of the Secretariat of the China Banking Association, said asset custody has become an important link connecting the money market, capital market and real economy. It is also an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security.</seg>
<seg id="3">Along with rapid development of China's direct financing market and wealth management market, the asset custody market has played an increasingly important role.</seg>
<seg id="4">Data from the report on development of China's asset custody industry in 2016 showed that the ratio of assets under custody to deposits reached 62.74% at the end of 2015, versus 17.11% at the end of 2011.</seg>
<seg id="5">The ratio of assets under custody to total deposits of financial institutions is often used to measure the status and function of the custody sector.</seg>

<seg id="4">Inner Mongolia Hulunbeir Zhongwei Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. and Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) Investment Co., Ltd. jointly developed a real estate project - Hulunbeir Shiji Tianlun Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Dong once acted as chairman and legal representative of the hotel company after its establishment with joint contributions by the two companies.</seg>
<seg id="6">Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel agreed that Mr. Dong would apply for withdrawing the case with the public security organ after performing the obligations prescribed in the agreement, and they will no longer hold Mr. Dong and other related personnel responsible for legal liabilities.</seg>
<seg id="7">After Mr. Dong fully performs the agreement, Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel will announce a waiver of rights to hold Zhongwei Real Estate Development, Mr. Dong and other related persons liable for criminal and civil responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the "agreement" signed on April 24, 2014, the four parties agreed to reach an agreement over fund embezzlement and appropriation by Mr. Dong and his subordinate staff.</seg>
<seg id="9">The agreement mainly prescribed the amount of funds Mr. Dong should return and the return time as well as the equity transfer and legal representative change of Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company.</seg>
<seg id="10">In October 2015, Zhongwei Real Estate Development and Mr. Dong, two parties of the agreement, brought the other two parties, namely, Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company, to court.</seg>
<seg id="11">The defendants replied that the public security organ's judicial audit came to the conclusion that Mr. Dong and the accountant embezzled and appropriated over RMB 29 million of funds.</seg>
<seg id="12">In February 2014, Mr. Dong got in touch with Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing), and the two parties signed the "agreement" after negotiations at the public security organ's meeting room.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Dong pleaded guilty, expressed confession and threw himself on the mercy of the court. He also returned the RMB 5 million of Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company.</seg>
<seg id="14">The entrusted agent of the plaintiffs said Mr. Dong learned after consulting legal specialists that it was controversial whether or not the "borrowing" behavior could be criminalized.</seg>
<seg id="15">The "agreement" was signed provided that Mr. Dong was convicted of the embezzlement crime, in contravention of the Twelfth Article of the Criminal Procedural Law.</seg>
<seg id="16">Giving criminal sanctions and equity transfer fall into different legal scopes, and the duo can't be confused and traded. What's more, equities can't be used to exchange for "impunity". The "agreement" covers illegal purposes in legal forms.</seg>
<seg id="17">The plaintiffs opined that it is the national public power of public security organ, procuratorate, court and other national legal authorities to give criminal sanctions, which is not bound by private appointments.</seg>
<seg id="18">The agreement signed by the two parties on April 24, 2014 violates the compulsory provisions of the national laws and regulations and infringes the social and public interests.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore, no matter whether Mr. Dong constitutes a crime, the agreement on "a waiver of rights to give criminal sanctions on the opposite side" has no legal effect.</seg>
<seg id="20">The entrusted agent of the defendants deemed that the "agreement" is the civil understanding reached between criminal suspects and victims in the process of criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="21">The "agreement" is signed and performed to recover the victims' financial losses to the greatest extent and reduce the criminal punishment on criminal suspects, which are not illegal purposes nor contrary to compulsory provisions of laws and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was Mr. Dong's real intention to sign the "agreement", which was legal and effective after being signed and sealed by all the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="23">The defendants thought that the "crime of position encroachment" and the "crime of funds misappropriation" are public-prosecuted cases, and it should be decided by the public security organ whether or not the case should be withdrawn, rather than the reporter.</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement is just an appointment, under which the victims would apply with the public security organ for withdrawal of the case after Mr. Dong fulfilled the agreement, which is not in conflict with the exercise of national public power to give criminal sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meanwhile, the court held that the liability for breach of contract is beyond the scope of ordinary civil agreements, and validity of the agreement should be reviewed in the process of criminal proceeding.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data showed that currently Shennongjia receives around 700,000 visitors each year, while professional statistical analysis found that it is inadvisable for Shennongjia to receive more than 800,000 visitors each year, which may damage resources and environment of the scenic spot.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is predicted that the number of visitors from home and abroad to Shennongjia will surge after it is inscribed to the World Heritage List, while Shennongjia made an early warning against the visitor number rather than blindly pursuing growth in the tourist number and income, which is laudable.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a necessary measure to protect the ecological environment of Shennongjia, and also a sustainable tourism road to realize the harmony between man and nature as well as man and resources in scenic spots.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being made World Heritage, Shennongjia has become the first heritage site in China and the second across the world to obtain three major honors, namely, the World Heritage, the Man and Biosphere Reserve and the World Geopark.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, Shennongjia forms the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Han River, and covers a total of four water systems, namely, Xiangxi River, Yandu River, Nanhe River and Duhe River.</seg>
<seg id="6">The proverb that "Mountain foot and top always see different seasons - midsummer against spring or autumn against winter, with the four seasons being difficult to distinguish" has highlighted the unique and typical climatic features of Shennongjia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thereout, Shennongjia's practice of promoting sustainable tourism to protect ecological environment rather than pursuing overexploitation is worth learning and referring to by other World Heritage scenic spots.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shennongjia stands out as the 50th World Heritage of our country, and China has become the second biggest country in terms of the number of World Heritage it secures. We shall strive to make the 50 World Heritages glow and pass them on to the future generations.</seg>
<seg id="9">For the time being, many heritage sites have been found "taking the application seriously but making light of preservation and protection, taking the exploitation seriously but making light of management", turning the World Heritage into a cash cow.</seg>
<seg id="10">Obviously, if the application for World Heritage is viewed from the economic perspective, a heritage will be taken as a "golden bowl", while its future will look grim no matter how good it is now.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are many past experiences to learn from at home and abroad; for instance, six World Heritage sites in China received yellow card warning at the Session of the World Heritage Committee held in 2010 mainly due to the change of ecological environment after overexploitation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hollywood blockbusters, which are well made, star-studded and hyped, have been featured in the film market in recent years. It seemed that all people are discussing them, and go to cinema to watch them together.</seg>
<seg id="2">Then is it truly as we thought that blockbusters always rock the cinema and make a bundle of money?</seg>
<seg id="3">Undoubtedly, the production costs of Hollywood blockbusters have been surging year by year, and the growth is even far beyond that of the inflation rate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Data from Chart 1 showed that the number of Hollywood films, which were produced during the decade from 1995 to 2004 and cost over US$100 million, totaled 60.</seg>
<seg id="5">While the figure surged to 197 during the 11 years from 2005 to 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">The sharp increase in film production number indicates a rising production cost on average, which has aroused alert of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="7">Famous directors Spielberg and Lucas once criticized such phenomenon in a forum activity, saying that if this continues, the industry would "implode".</seg>
<seg id="8">Among these 29 films, the highest proportion of marketing costs to total costs stood at 40%, while the lowest even reached as high as 24%.</seg>
<seg id="9">The average costs of physical copy, production of audio and video products and transport reached US$67.8 million for each film.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is very important to make a correct estimation of the number of copies and audio and video products to be made, especially in the DVD market that adopts the marketing policy of accepting goods return.</seg>
<seg id="11">In 2005, DreamWorks made 5 million DVD copies of Shrek 2 but found a poor sales market, which made the company fail to realize its income target of the quarter as a result.</seg>
<seg id="12">An average amount of US$36.6 million needed to be taken out from these 29 films for revenue sharing and compensation among directors, producers, scriptwriters, protagonists as well as other cast and crew.</seg>
<seg id="13">For Hollywood studios, the revenue sharing mechanism could help them reduce financial pressure in the early stage, while it turns out to be an incentive for the cast and crew.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among these 29 films, profitable ones shared 9% of income on average and one even shared as much as 18%, while films that suffered losses also shared around 5% of income on average.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is noteworthy that the cast and crew would ask for share the "revenue" rather than the "profit".</seg>
<seg id="16">Under operation of the tricky accounting system of Hollywood, some films that could have made a bundle may eventually turn out to be in the red.</seg>
<seg id="17">For instance, a report revealed about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2010 indicated that Warner still claimed two years after distribution of the film that it lost US$167 million in the film, making profit sharing an empty talk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hollywood also needs to pay a certain amount of bonus to the union formed by various working staff, while these 29 films paid an average of US$11.76 million for that.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the operating costs of Hollywood Pictures would also be shared by films, while these 29 films shared an average of US$14.83 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">After deducting the sales tax and gains shared by cinemas, the film company could receive 53% box office sales of the North America and 41% of the world, amounting to around US$169 million.</seg>
<seg id="21">After an average marketing expense of US$98 million for distribution was deducted, there was only around US$70 million left.</seg>
<seg id="22">These 29 films each generated an average income of US$134.3 million from distribution of home audio and video products.</seg>
<seg id="23">After deducting the average marketing expense of US$21.9 million and production cost of US$30.5 million, the net income stood at US$81.9 million on average, which topped the income list. Its profit rate was much higher than that of theatrical distribution.</seg>
<seg id="24">Paid TV channels created US$14.6 million of income on average for these films, a little bit more than the US$13.3 million created by free-to-air channels.</seg>
<seg id="25">Among these 29 films, about half generated less than 1% of income from video on demand (VOD), and even films released after 2011 only generated 4.1% of income from this business.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hollywood still took a relatively conservative attitude toward VOD when building the distribution system of these blockbusters.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for derivative development, these 29 films generated an average income of US$11.5 million by authorizing derivative development.</seg>
<seg id="28">Yet, almost two thirds of the derivative development income came from the top two super blockbusters, and only one third of them earned more than US$1 million from this.</seg>
<seg id="29">Apart from the sources of income mentioned above, these Hollywood blockbusters still had bits of income from aircraft broadcast and music, which averaged at US$2.7 million at most for each film.</seg>
<seg id="30">Surprisingly, Stephen's statistics showed that these 29 Hollywood blockbusters generated US$14.8 million of profits on average, while the profit rate only reached 3.7%.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the long revenue recovery process is taken into account, this profit rate could hardly beat the inflation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Films with costs in the lowest range between US$100 million and US$125 million delivered the worst performance in profitability, and only one third of them earned money.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, three quarters of the films with costs in the highest range of above US$200 million made profits.</seg>

<seg id="1">With a splendid civilization and numerous people, China stood at the forefront of the world development for several centuries. Now the country has become the second largest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="2">Speaking of the word, we realize that it not only implies too much meaning but also carries rich contents.</seg>
<seg id="3">Without doubt, the proposition of setting up cultural self-confidence is based on the sufficient identification of their own culture value as well as the firm confidence in its vitality on the part of the CPC and the Chinese people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many people have realized that in Xi Jinping's series of talks, articles, speeches and interviews, famous quotations from ancient Chinese books and records as well as classics are found everywhere, manifesting highly cultural self-confidence and arousing the widespread resonance all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">Facts have proved that along with the rise of contemporary China, the influence and attraction of the Chinese culture is increasingly being strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese modern history of over 100 years has already told us that all the road, theory and system are rooted in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, for a time, we learned from Western countries about their implements, systems and cultures and kept rethinking in this process.</seg>
<seg id="8">After a long-term exploration, we have found that the firm confidence in China's modernization derives from the "spiritual gene" of the Chinese nation.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Xi Jinping's speeches and investigations, the discussions on excellent traditional Chinese culture including Confucianism are beyond count.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the 18th collective study of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Xi Jinping all the more emphasized that China's today is just the development of her yesterday and the day before yesterday.</seg>

<seg id="12">We have not occasionally blazed the socialist road with Chinese characteristics, which is determined by the historical inheritance and cultural tradition of our country.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2010, China's GDP stood second in the world. However, China' achievements are more than economy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has attached more prominent importance to the construction of a powerful socialist cultural country, dedicated to initiating a new "golden age" of cultural development.</seg>

<seg id="1">Known as the sternest anti-corruption law in the history of the Republic of Korea, the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act will come into force next month. According to the law, the expenses per capita of a civil servant who accepts a banquet shall not exceed 30,000 Korea won (approximately RMB 181 yuan)</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report by Yonhap on August 10, this stipulation poses a challenge to many first-class Korean restaurants that were originally going to exclusively entertain political figures and senior civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Quite a number of restaurants have to adjust the standard of table money and promote more inexpensive set meals. Some restaurants have closed down or switched to other industries once and for all.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many Korean restaurant bosses are worried about their future business because of the law, Yonhap reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Insadong of Seoul, a restaurant which has been doing business since 1969 is often patronized by political figures, government officials, media reporters and merchants.</seg>
<seg id="6">The boss of the restaurant told the reporter from Yonhap that for many years they have been proud of offering luxury food and private dining environment to customers.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past ten years, the restaurant has offered high-specification set meals. However, "in order to satisfy the upper limit of table money set by The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, we will have to change the tradition of several decades, which is really a difficult decision."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Charcoal Fire Barbecue Village" mainly offers beef barbecue. According to its general manager, the price of "Han-u" (Korean beef), a signature dish of the restaurant, is over 50,000 Korean won.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We predict that from October on, the sales volume will greatly reduce so we are considering replacing Han-u in set meals with imported beef."</seg>
<seg id="10">Located in Jongno district, Seoul, the restaurant which was well-known for the patronage by political VIPs such as former presidents Roh Tae-woo and Lee Myung-bak closed down last month.</seg>
<seg id="11">The boss of the restaurant said that as partial Korean government departments have been moved to Sejong, the restaurant's volume of business has suffered a great shock. It is estimated that after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act takes effect, the number of guests will be even smaller.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before long, the restaurant will divert to engaging in Vietnam rice noodles and the per capita dining standard is around 10, 000 Korean Won (RMB 60 yuan).</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the prediction of the Korean Catering Service Industry Association, in the first year after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act is put into force, the income of hotel industry in S. Korea will reduce by 4.15 trillion Korean Won (RMB 25 billion yuan) year on year.</seg>
<seg id="14">Facing the possible economic loss, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said at a cabinet conference on the 10th day that what is important is to reduce its negative effects as far as possible while sticking to the core part of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.</seg>
<seg id="15">She said, "Once the law is put into force, the social transparency and fairness will be more or less improved and the efficiency in economy will increase, too. Therefore, the economic growth of S. Korea will speed up."</seg>

<seg id="1">According to chinanews.com on August 12, Sheng Laiyun, press spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said today that the surveyed urban unemployment rate in Liaoning is higher than the national average level. Since its economy is experiencing adjustment, the interior pressure is rather big.</seg>
<seg id="2">Today, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference with regard to the operation of national economy in July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judging from the over-all situation, since the international economy is under deep adjustment, its recovery is relatively slow, which will bring about a large pressure on China's import including the import of Liaoning province.</seg>
<seg id="4">Domestically, as China is in the critical period of structural adjustment, the contradiction between the surplus of traditional industries and the inadequacy in the growth of market effective demand is rather acute and the throes caused by the adjustment of traditional industries are still being released.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore, in this new round of adjustment, it is the price of the products of heavy and chemical industries that is undergoing the deepest adjustment, thus inevitably bringing downward pressure on the economy of Liaoning.</seg>
<seg id="6">During the 12th Five-Year Plan, due to the development of urbanization and the expansion of the real estate, the development of infrastructure in Liaoning was sound and the base of its real estate was fairly high.</seg>
<seg id="7">After entering the period of the 13th Five-Year Plan, since its original base number was high, in terms of data manifestation, this round of adjustment has much more been reduced than other region.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sheng Laiyun summarized that the economic adjustment of Liaoning has its special economic reasons, including not only the influence of cyclical factors, but also that of structural factors and even that of base effect and that generally it is in the process of adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sheng Laiyun also revealed that since its economy is being adjusted, the fact that the urban unemployment rate of Liaoning is higher than the national average level indicates that its interior pressure is rather big.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the observation of the data in the recent two months, there is an indication that the economy of Liaoning will be stabilized and the index reduction degree is becoming narrow.</seg>
<seg id="11">We believe that through the joint efforts of all aspects, the economy in the northeastern region including Liaoning will display the vitality of the former old industrial base for the second time.</seg>

<seg id="3">Wang Xinliang said that he has once encountered a case, in which the healthcare product sellers call the elderly either fathers or mothers on lecture sites, which made the elderly feel at home. However, it was actually an emotional marketing trick.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We felt the treatment effect was good after taking the products. However, they were marked up to RMB 3,000 one week later. Then, we didn't buy them again."</seg>
<seg id="5">Wang Xinliang said that according to the cases he has encountered in recent two years. The elderly were easy to be cheated. Most of the frauds took place when they buy drugs, healthcare products and wealth management products.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Some elderly people bought a great number of healthcare products. Some who have high retirement pay didn't follow their kids' advice although they knew they had been cheated. Some even had conflicts with their family members."</seg>

<seg id="2">About 56.4% respondents of the survey said consumers' right to give negative comments is an objective reflection of the public monitoring system in the virtual online society, while 79.3% believed that it is necessary to launch relevant measures to protect consumers' right to give negative comments.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, merchants' pressure should never be released through illegal means, while consumers should make good use of their rights.</seg>
<seg id="4">If the comments of consumers are pertinent, you should accept such comments and improve your services.</seg>
<seg id="5">If someone's comments are aimed to weaken your competitiveness on purpose. You can safeguard your rights according to the regulations of the anti-unfair competition law.</seg>
<seg id="6">If their malicious slanders damage your business reputation and credits, you can lodge a civil litigation or report the case to relevant authorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to relevant regulations in law, if merchants publicize your information to revenge you for your comments, they are actually infringing your reputation and information security rights. However, it will cost a lot of time and efforts for you to file a lawsuit against them.</seg>
<seg id="8">E-commerce platforms have to give play to their monitoring role when relevant administrative departments are investigating and dealing with such cases.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, those who publicize others' personal information should be held responsible through laws and regulations. Also, there should be a regulation on the punishment of online slanders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A series of bomb blasts across five of Thailand's southern provinces targeted popular tourist destinations on Thursday and Friday, leaving four people dead and many more injured, after the country voted to approve a military-backed constitution.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two explosions first hit the seaside resort of Hua Hin on Thursday night, before another blast struck on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The town is located some 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first blast killed one Thai woman and injured 20 people, 10 of them foreigners, police said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Authorities confirmed that other blasts had targeted the southern cities of Phuket, Trang and Surat Thani.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two bombs exploded in the town of Patong in Phuket and two more in Phang Nga, another tourist region just north of Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="8">A total of 11 bomb blasts struck the country over the last 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="9">The blasts were not linked to Islamic extremism but acts of local sabotage, Royal Thai Police official Col. Krisana Patanacharoen said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's too soon to jump to any conclusion," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">But what we know for sure is that the incidents are not linked directly to any kinds of terrorism, in fact it's local sabotage and we are trying to identify those responsible behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Investigation officials collect evidence from the crime scene after a small bomb exploded in Hua Hin on August 12, 2016.</seg>
<seg id="13">A string of bomb attacks targeting Thailand's crucial tourism industry have killed four people, officials said on August 12, sending authorities scrambling to identify a motive and find the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are no conflicts in the country that may lead to terrorists being in the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="16">No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and authorities have not accused any particular group, but the explosions occurred in the same week that Thai voters approved a new constitution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The three southern provinces of Hua Hin, Phuket and Phang Nga all rejected the military-backed referendum, and the Muslim-majority southeastern provinces of Thailand have faced an insurgency that has left more than 6,500 people dead since 2004.</seg>

<seg id="1">Signs of Trouble in Ukraine Prompt Question: What's Vladimir Putin Up To?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's difficult to judge the truth of these claims.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ukraine denies them, and both the United States and the European Union say Russia has provided no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">An open-source analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, found some indications of a firefight on Saturday, but little to back up Moscow's grander claims.</seg>
<seg id="5">Russia has been known to distort or misstate events to serve political ends, particularly within the fog of Ukraine's still-ongoing conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are all false.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ukrainian militias last year sabotaged electricity pylons that power Crimea, and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights violations.</seg>
<seg id="8">An attempted attack in Crimea is not out of the question, though there is little reason to suspect the Ukrainian government would sponsor such a plot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whatever happened, images found by open-source analysts suggest that Russia has been escalating its military presence in Crimea since at least Saturday - before the supposed attack occurred.</seg>
<seg id="10">These show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula, including missile systems intended for coastal defense.</seg>
<seg id="11">A disturbingly familiar Russian escalation</seg>
<seg id="12">Some reports indicate that Russia's troops in Crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now, which would help explain the activity, though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whatever transpired over the weekend, Mr. Putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward Ukraine, choosing to use this episode - however real it was - for some larger aim.</seg>
<seg id="14">Analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February 2014, similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for Crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula, then still controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal they were in fact Russian special forces launching a military occupation.</seg>
<seg id="16">That August, as Russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed troops along the border, warning they might be necessary to "protect" ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who he said were under attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">He orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that, according to NATO, was mere cover for a Russian invasion force.</seg>
<seg id="18">What is Mr. Putin planning in Crimea?</seg>
<seg id="19">Some have wondered whether Moscow might be plotting another intervention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fighting has increased in eastern Ukraine, as it did before the August 2014 incursion.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that seeming parallel may be the point, meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give Mr. Putin leverage with Ukraine and with Western countries.</seg>
<seg id="22">Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern Ukraine, which borders mainland Russia but not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better defended.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's highly unlikely that the Russians are truly planning some major offensive," Mr. Galeotti said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rather, "We're looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up tension."</seg>
<seg id="25">International peace talks over Ukraine, once the mechanism by which Mr. Putin forced contact with Western leaders who had shunned him over annexing Crimea, have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="26">By dangling the threat of renewed conflict, Mr. Putin gives the talks a new purpose: to coax him back from the brink.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to go there from a position of strength," Mr. Galeotti said of the next peace talks, planned for early September.</seg>
<seg id="28">"And the only real strength is to say, "I could make things much, much worse if I wanted to." "</seg>
<seg id="29">Positioning for a bargain with the West</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr. Putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the Crimea tensions, forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process.</seg>
<seg id="31">What does this actually get him?</seg>
<seg id="32">For one, it allows Russia to continue asserting itself as a global power, even though its economy is smaller than Australia's.</seg>
<seg id="33">For another, it positions Moscow as having a veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, keeping the country within some degree of Russian control.</seg>
<seg id="34">It may also serve Mr. Putin's long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the United States that would settle their disputes over Ukraine and Syria - on terms favorable to Moscow, naturally - as well as ending Western sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr. Putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation's economy began collapsing in late 2014, due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since intervening in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited Western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists.</seg>
<seg id="37">But Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before January, when President Obama will leave office.</seg>
<seg id="38">Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">Donald J. Trump, while conspicuously friendly toward Russia, is still seen as unpredictable.</seg>
<seg id="40">But Mr. Obama is seen as "looking for resolutions, not conflicts," Mr. Galeotti said.</seg>
<seg id="41">So there is a sense that there's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the meantime, should no grand bargain come, Mr. Putin appears happy to keep Russia's weaker neighbor guessing about what's coming next.</seg>
<seg id="43">An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was 2014, not 2013.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds to Fight Zika</seg>
<seg id="2">The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month.</seg>
<seg id="4">That would force the development of a vaccine to stop at a critical time, as locally acquired cases of Zika infection increase in Miami.</seg>
<seg id="5">As of last week, 7,350 cases of Zika had been reported in the United States, most in Puerto Rico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ms. Burwell said that 15 infants had been born with Zika-related birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="7">The virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The local spread of the illness in the continental United States, with the first cases reported late last month, has raised the political stakes surrounding the federal government's response.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hillary Clinton on Tuesday made a campaign stop in Wynwood, the Miami neighborhood that has had a rash of locally transmitted Zika cases, and pressed Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus.</seg>
<seg id="10">President Obama and congressional Republicans have been at odds for most of the year over Zika.</seg>
<seg id="11">In February, Mr. Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Republicans balked, demanding a more detailed accounting of where the money would go.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lawmakers have feuded for months over how much money should be earmarked and how it should be spent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of a Republican measure that would have allocated $1.1 billion to fight Zika but included provisions that would have banned funding for Planned Parenthood to provide contraception related to the virus, which can be sexually transmitted.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deadlock prompted the White House in April to shift $589 million in Ebola funding to the Zika effort, about two-thirds of it designated for domestic use.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Thursday, Ms. Burwell said that her department had used most of that money, and that it would be gone by the end of August.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays," Ms. Burwell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democrats seized on the announcement to berate Republicans for failing to provide additional money for Zika.</seg>
<seg id="19">At a news conference, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, called on Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, to bring Congress back to advance such a measure.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Every possible option is being exhausted, and now we're going into the National Institutes of Health, which is supposed to be a priority," Ms. Pelosi said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aides to Mr. Ryan said that shifting the funds was a long-overdue step that the Obama administration had delayed to squeeze maximum political advantage out of the Zika issue.</seg>
<seg id="22">The National Institutes of Health announced last week that it had begun clinical trials of a Zika vaccine on 80 human subjects, and hoped to begin a second phase in "Zika-endemic countries" in early 2017.</seg>
<seg id="23">But without more funding now, officials said Thursday, the research would halt in its tracks.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ms. Burwell said she would transfer to the Zika efforts $34 million in N.I.H. funds that had been designated to find treatments for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="25">Another $47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of drugs and vaccines to respond to public health emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="26">That money will come out of a variety of accounts, including $19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidies for low-income families and $4 million from substance abuse programs such as those for opioid addiction.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even then, Ms. Burwell said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point agencies would have to "severely curtail many of their critical efforts" against Zika without action from Congress.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the last four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their Zika preparedness and response plans, and $16 million to help them create data-collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika-related syndromes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thai Leader Links Attacks on Tourist Sites to Constitution Change</seg>
<seg id="2">The head of the Thai junta urged his countrymen on Friday to have patience while investigators determine who was behind a wave of deadly bombings in Thailand this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, hinted that the perpetrators were "bad people" opposed to a new Constitution that was approved by voters on Sunday in a nationwide referendum.</seg>
<seg id="4">"There are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the referendum," he said in an address to the nation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, areas popular with tourists, killed four people and injured dozens.</seg>
<seg id="6">The authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many people, but rather at damaging the tourism industry, one of the few bright spots in Thailand's economy.</seg>
<seg id="8">At least nine foreign visitors were injured in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Whatever the motives are, the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation would be stable," said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="10">These attacks create effects that discredit the authorities, terrorize the public and harm the tourism-based economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Photo Thai rescue workers treated a victim injured by a bomb that exploded in Hua Hin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police said they did not believe that the bombings were tied to international terrorism or to a long-running Islamic insurgency in southern Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have portrayed the attacks as "local sabotage," not terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="14">The timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism.</seg>
<seg id="15">The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="16">Four bombs struck the royal residential town of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most injuries occurred.</seg>
<seg id="17">The military-drafted Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control.</seg>
<seg id="18">The junta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled over the vote.</seg>
<seg id="20">The bombings were "clearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries," he said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Last year, a bombing at the popular Erewan shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them tourists from China.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thai officials attributed the bombing to Uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.</seg>
<seg id="23">General Prayuth, who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government, said this week's bombings "hurt the hearts" of Thai people.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Why now, when the country is getting better, the economy is getting better, and tourism is getting better?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have to ask why, and who did it.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Fight to Protect L.G.B.T. Students in Colombia</seg>
<seg id="2">Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego jumped to his death from a shopping center in Bogotá, leaving as his suicide note a Facebook post quoting Pink Floyd's "Goodbye Cruel World."</seg>
<seg id="3">His death was the genesis of a controversy that roiled Colombia this week, as the effort to expand L.G.B.T. rights was drawn into a broader political fight that has polarized the nation.</seg>
<seg id="4">After his death, Mr. Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year later, Colombia's highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor, calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="6">The decision was part of a string of legal victories for Colombia's gay rights movement, which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage.</seg>
<seg id="7">This week, though, their fight for equality hit an obstacle as Gina Parody, the minister of education - who is openly gay - became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media, peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ms. Parody quickly debunked that.</seg>
<seg id="10">While the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling, it has not sought to impose standardized rules.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts," Ms. Parody said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerrilla group.</seg>
<seg id="13">A coalition of politicians opposed to the government and leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized with extraordinary speed, accusing the government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender fluidity.</seg>
<seg id="14">To complicate matters, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an accord on gender and L.G.B.T. equality that calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Critics of the government - and the peace talks - pounced on Ms. Parody, a 42-year-old rising star in Colombian politics.</seg>
<seg id="16">They displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Álvarez-Correa Glen, the former commerce minister.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ms. Parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Part of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a tough stage and a very lonely time.</seg>
<seg id="20">She also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over L.G.B.T. students.</seg>
<seg id="21">As Colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the FARC, which would mark an seismic turning point for the country, they must consider the roots of the conflict, she said.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?" she said.</seg>
<seg id="23">While she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week, she is glad that in today's Colombia, gay students can look up to her and consider that they, too, can aspire to serve as a minister one day.</seg>
<seg id="24">"To me, it's critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential," Ms. Parody said.</seg>
<seg id="25">We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing.</seg>

<seg id="1">The UK government recently announced suddenly the suspension of the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station in the UK in partnership with China and France, attracting a wide spread attention at home and abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2">A UK government spokesman recently said that the deferral of the project does not mean the UK has chilled its enthusiasm for China, as China and the UK are still cooperating in a wide range of sectors and the UK will continue to seek to maintain the strong partnership with China.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some experts pointed out that China's nuclear power leads the world in technical level, safety performance, operating experience and all other aspects, as well as has relatively low costs.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, although "Nuclear Power Going Global" will experience trials and tribulations in a given period, the trend of mutually beneficial cooperation between the parties will not be changed in the context of huge win-win potential.</seg>
<seg id="5">But these words clearly do not hold true for what the UK did in the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station.</seg>
<seg id="6">Once the project is completed, it will meet 7 percent of the UK's power demands and help reduce 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually in the operation period of 60 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts generally believe that complicated factors in the UK such as exposed economic risks, increasing disputes among domestic politics, cumbersome subsequent procedures after Brexit, and increasing future uncertainties all impede its nuclear power projects.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Currently, since property prices in the UK are falling and outflow of capital starts occurring, keeping domestic economy and market system stable has been the top priority of the UK's new government.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, after the approval of Brexit vote, the UK also needs to face a number of Brexit procedures in the coming days and straighten out its relationship with EU countries like France again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Xu Mingqi said that though the UK's new government shows apparent eagerness to "differentiate from" the previous government, it does not deny the positive significance of nuclear power projects.</seg>
<seg id="11">Over the past two decades, however, the UK has seen the stagnation of the development of its nuclear power, and a majority of its existing 15 nuclear power stations have reached their design lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the prediction of the UK's Energy White Paper, there will be only one nuclear power station still in service in the UK by 2025, leading to major gaps in electric power supply.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, the parties express their common concerns about the suspension of this project benefiting the public welfare by the UK government.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the view of Scuoler, where it is in the interests of the both countries, China can play a key role in helping the UK reconstructing infrastructures.</seg>
<seg id="15">Liu Xiaoming said that we look forward to successfully starting and implementing the project as early as possible, providing the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable energy.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to insiders, projects of nuclear power stations are instrumental in the reduction of electricity cost for the British public, while at the same time driving local economy and employment.</seg>
<seg id="17">So, if the UK's new government makes a final decision from the prospective of maximizing its people's welfare, nuclear power projects will not see a gloomy outlook.</seg>
<seg id="18">The UK side can address energy demand gap, and the sides of both China and France can find the market for their own advantageous technologies and products in the field of nuclear power, benefiting more people."</seg>
<seg id="19">In spite of the increasing uncertainty of the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, there is no doubt about China's high-level and sophisticated experience in nuclear power technology.</seg>
<seg id="20">Taking China's "Hualong 1" that will enter the British nuclear power market as scheduled as an example, it incorporates the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technologies and drew previous experience in design.</seg>
<seg id="21">For instance, China has designed the "passive residual heat removal system at the secondary side of vapor generator" based on problems reflected in Japan's Fukushima nuclear accident, which can remove the heat from reactor cores in time, avoiding the meltdown of reactor cores.</seg>
<seg id="22">Liu Xiaoming said that China has been keeping a good track record and safety level during the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years, and international institutions set a high value on the achievements it has made in nuclear power development and regulatory.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is now an important historic moment for the relationship between China and the UK, so mutual respect and trust are more valuable than ever.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Chinese side hoped that the UK government continues to support the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, and makes a decision as early as possible to ensure the successful implementation of the project.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the opinion of He Weiwen, Co-chair of the Sino-America-Europe Economic Strategy Research Center, the China Association of International Trade (CAIT), since there is limited time for the British side to make the decision, the both parties need more substantive communications and dialogues.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Following the change of president of Argentina, the China-Argentina nuclear power station project was also laid aside temporarily, but it has now been clearly scheduled to begin construction in the first quarter of next year."</seg>

<seg id="1">After Mr. Li was sent to the hospital, the doctor told his family members that he was in a serious situation because he was in a hyperosmolar coma caused by severe dehydration as a result of diarrhea, and he might die if sent here a few minutes later.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to statistics, the symptom of diarrhea might be found in some 20% of diabetics, particularly previously untreated patients or those whose blood glucose has not been controlled properly.</seg>
<seg id="3">For some diabetics, chronic diarrhea might even the primary disease symptom, which is so deceptive and then leads to missed diagnosis and misdiagnose.</seg>
<seg id="4">Diarrhea in the wake of dyspepsia can lead to anorexia and nausea, and taking digestives can help the illness take a turn for a better way; for bacterial diarrhea, the disease generally comes in suddenly and several times a day, accompanying with the feeling of abdominal pain, but it can get recovery after a short-term treatment.</seg>
<seg id="5">And for diabetic diarrhea, it is mostly expressed in refractory diarrhea without obvious abdominal pain and with assayed excrements that do not accompany infection in most cases, but the number of diarrhea is significantly increased, up to 20-plus times a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Additionally, when some hypoglycemic drugs such as melbine (DMBG) or α-glucosidase inhibitor are taken at very onset, patients might happen to side effects like abdominal distension, abdominal pain and diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is because stress hyperglycemia together with hypoglycemia condition might occur after diarrhea in case of inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moreover, human body is in a stress situation due to diarrhea, releasing multiple hormones. While its confrontation with diarrhea, human body will also suffer from much blood glucose that outflows, which might cause ketoacidosis in severe cases.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, in addition to etiological treatment in hospital, diabetics should also pay attention to the following aspects after diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="10">Diabetics suffering from acute diarrhea must prevent dehydration first, so it is necessary to drink more water, which naturally helps them with more urination, allowing for draining unnecessary blood glucose as well as acetone bodies.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is best not to have drinks containing caffeine because caffeine can stimulate gastrointestinal motility and then aggravate diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="12">For diabetics, blood glucose regulation will be out of balance in case of acute diarrhea, so they must closely observe the changes of blood glucose. It is best to measure blood glucose every 3 to 4 hours.</seg>

<seg id="7">Plus, the sweat gland of little kids is in the development, and the sweat gland and dermal gland of some children have not been balanced yet, leading to the inability to sweat.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Some parents have a good habit by carrying a small towel with them and immediately wiping away the sweat on their kid once found."</seg>

<seg id="11">For example, a shower for babies is taken every day at ordinary times, and now it can be increased to twice a day. However, flushing is just OK in the second bath, without the use of any bath supplies.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, to prevent skin diseases in summer, anti-miliaria potion containing some herb ingredients like honeysuckle can be dripped into the bath water for babies, which can help disperse pore and perspire.</seg>
<seg id="13">The above are essentials for parents to protect their kid's skin. For different skin diseases, parents can also adopt the following different treatment methods.</seg>

<seg id="2">Oguchi got 24 points, including 7 of 12 three-pointers and all the 3 free throws made but no scores from the field, Akognon contributed 12 points and 5 rebounds, and Ibekwe scored 11 points and 5 rebounds.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a traditional European team, Spain was severely weakened by the absence of its star player Marc Gasol, which had it on the ropes and even made it hard to advance from the group.</seg>
<seg id="4">Facing the weakest competitor Nigeria in the group, Spain also played very hard and scraped through the game at the eleventh hour.</seg>
<seg id="5">Within the last 1 minute 20 seconds in this quarter, Nigeria failed to score again, and Rodriguez hit a three-pointer to help Spain take a 25-11 lead into the first-quarter break after 5 straight points.</seg>
<seg id="6">When there were 3'54'' to go in the second quarter, Gasol made a driving layup to help Spain hold the lead at 40-27.</seg>
<seg id="7">When there were 6'09'' left in this quarter, Llull hit two free throws for a 61-48 Spain lead, a two-digit advantage once again.</seg>
<seg id="8">After Oguchi's three-pointer for Nigeria, Spain scored 4 straight points to extend its lead to 14.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, within the last 4 minutes 49 seconds in this quarter, Spain stopped scoring. On the contrary, Nigeria ended this quarter with a wave of 13-0 including points in the paint and outside shots for a 66-65 lead, the first in the whole game.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this wave of attacks, Nigeria hit two three-pointers and a foul outside the three-pointer line.</seg>

<seg id="2">After a short-term adjustment courtside, Yu Dabao returned to the pitch, but his trouble hasn't been cleared up. So, he was substituted by Song Boxuan in the 76th minute due to his inability to hold on later in the game.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is more, Yu Dabao could not move by himself and was stretchered off. After a 10-minute treatment courtside, he was directly sent into an emergency ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="4">As far as the "national football squad" is concerned, the possible injury of Yu Dabao will certainly affect China's competition for the Russia 2018 Asian Qualifiers that will kick off half a month later.</seg>

<seg id="1">However, engineers from University of California, Berkeley, have advanced this concept and developed a tiny wireless sensor that can be used to monitor the health condition inside human body.</seg>
<seg id="2">The researchers introduced their invention on the Neuron published on August 3.</seg>
<seg id="3">On top of that, these battery-free sensors can be used to stimulate nerve and muscle.</seg>
<seg id="4">This will probably offer a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate human immune system.</seg>
<seg id="5">This device has been implanted into the muscle and peripheral nerve of rats, and uses ultrasound as energy source, which is also used to read collected data.</seg>
<seg id="6">This sensor has been compressed to 1 mm3, called "Neural Dust" which includes a piezo-electric crystal.</seg>
<seg id="7">The author of this paper explained that the crystal converts the vibration of ultrasound emitted outside the human body into electricity to drive a tiny transistor, which is directly attached to a nerve or muscle fibers, inside the device.</seg>
<seg id="8">Voltage peak in fibers causes changes of current circuit and crystal vibration, so that ultrasonic receiver (which currently is still the source that sends ultrasonic vibration) can detect echo.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now that ultrasonic technology is very common in hospitals and ultrasonic vibration can penetrate most parts of human body, it seems to be a natural choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">Michael Maharbiz is an associate professor of electronic engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the co-corresponding author of the paper, he said in a statement, "I believe that the long-term prospect of neural dust is not restricted to nerve and brain, but much broader."</seg>
<seg id="12">Maharbiz, together with his colleagues and Jose Carmena, a neuroscientist at University of California, Berkeley, led the research.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was utterly impossible to adopt internal telemetry technology in the past, because a tiny object cannot be put into a very deep place," explained he.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Now, however, I can take a tiny object and put it near nerve, organ, digestive tract or muscle, which then can read data."</seg>
<seg id="15">To test their device, Maharbiz and Caarmena utilized six 540ns ultrasonic pulse sent per 100ms to drive sensor.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the researchers feel quite confident that they can also work in the brain and central nervous system.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The neural dust project is created with a vision of describing next generation brain-machine exchange and interaction and making it a feasible clinic technology."</seg>
<seg id="18">"If a paralyzed patient hopes to control a computer or a robot arm, you can implant this electrode into his/her brain, where it can continuously work for a lifetime."</seg>

<seg id="1">Macy's to close 100 stores</seg>
<seg id="2">Department store giant Macy's said on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, it says, has too many stores for the online shopping era.</seg>
<seg id="3">Macy's regularly prunes its store portfolio, often moving to close several dozen underperforming stores right after the annual holiday rush.</seg>
<seg id="4">But in dropping a summertime announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 locations, the chain appears to be adopting a more aggressive posture than many of its retail industry counterparts about girding its fleet for the reality of a fast-changing shopping environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pedestrians and shoppers pass in front of a Macy's store in New York.</seg>
<seg id="6">The retail giant has said it plans to close 100 stores.</seg>
<seg id="7">Macy's has plenty of reasons to scramble to make a change: Many of its stores are located in small, regional malls, the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard-hit by the rise of e-commerce.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the department store category has generally struggled as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and fast-fashion players such as H&M to buy their clothes.</seg>
<seg id="9">These factors, along with short-term hitches such as decreased spending by international tourists and unseasonable weather, have left Macy's in a rough patch that has stretched for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Thursday, the company said it saw a 2.6 per cent drop in comparable sales in the most recent quarter, a weak performance that was nonetheless an improvement over the dismal 6.1 per cent year-over-year decline it recorded in the previous quarter.</seg>
<seg id="11">The retailer's revenue was $US5.87 billion ($A7.64 billion), down 3.9 per cent from the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Macy's said the store closures would probably cost it about $US1 billion in annual sales.</seg>
<seg id="13">And at one time, such a large batch of store closures might have been viewed as a retailer's concession of defeat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Yet the company's stock soared 17 per cent on Thursday, a sign that investors view the move as a proactive measure that portends a stronger future for Macy's.</seg>
<seg id="15">In some ways, it should not come as a surprise that Macy's is slashing stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">Terry Lundgren, the retailer's chief executive, has said before that the chain simply had too many stores.</seg>
<seg id="17">Executives have been saying for some time that they are embracing a strategy that puts particular emphasis on roughly 150 of their top-performing stores, trying to wring more sales out of those already-productive locations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jeff Gennette, the Macy's executive who has been appointed to replace Lundgren in 2017, said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and profitability have been sliding.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We recognise that these locations do not yield an adequate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand," Gennette said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date.</seg>
<seg id="21">Macy's said it is still finalising which stores it would shutter, and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be slashed.</seg>
<seg id="22">The retailer will not pull out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently operates stores, but will look to close stores that are in weak locations.</seg>
<seg id="23">The move is likely unwelcome news to mall operators, who count on big tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping centres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is your water bottle harbouring dangerous bacteria?</seg>
<seg id="2">According to new research, drinking from refillable water bottle can be "many times worse than licking your dog's toy" in terms of the amount of bacteria it will bring you into contact with.</seg>
<seg id="3">The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types - screw-top, slide-top, squeeze-top, and straw-top.</seg>
<seg id="4">Each water bottle had been used by an athlete for a week without being washed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your refillable water bottle could be as dirty as a dog toy.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CFU/sq cm)," Treadmill Reviews said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Slide-top were found to have the highest germ content, with more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CFU/sq) cm on average.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bottles harboured gram-positive cocci, which can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="9">Squeeze-top bottles were next-worse with 162,000 CFU/sq cm, and screw-top containers hosted just under 160,000 CFU/sq cm.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Drinking from these bottles can still be worse than eating a meal from your pet's dish," the site added.</seg>
<seg id="11">A far better picture emerged from tests on straw-top bottles, which were found to contain a fraction of the bacteria of other bottles - just 25 CFU/sq cm.</seg>
<seg id="12">This may be because water drips to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking around to attract moisture-loving germs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The germs that were present in the straw-top bottles were described as "mostly harmless."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Based on our test results, we suggest opting for a straw-top bottle, both for the low prevalence of bacteria and the lack of harmful germs," the site said.</seg>
<seg id="15">We also know that when it comes to water bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, water bottles without crevices and tough-to-clean spots are less likely to host germs.</seg>
<seg id="17">The site advises readers to wash water bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleach solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Religion must either modernise or face obsolescence</seg>
<seg id="2">In the United States the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="3">If the results of the latest polls hold true at election time, America will swear in its first female president in January.</seg>
<seg id="4">The previous week, across the pond, British Prime Minister Theresa May was negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from Europe with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="5">Women living in Western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work.</seg>
<seg id="6">And young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of leadership.</seg>
<seg id="7">So is the long and hard battle for women's equality finally over?</seg>
<seg id="8">Hillary Clinton is poised to become president of the United States, but in the religious sphere women's leadership is still a contentious issue.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, not entirely.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the religious sphere women's leadership remains a contentious issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last week Pope Francis announced a new commission to consider whether women should be made deacons in the Catholic Church.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Anglican Church consecrated Libby Lane as its first female bishop in January 2015, but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the Jewish Reform movement has been ordaining female rabbis since the early 1970s, and the Conservative movement since the early 1980s, in Orthodox Judaism the notion of female rabbis is still hotly contested.</seg>
<seg id="14">In November 2015, the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America - in its third attempt to stem the growing tide of support for Orthodox women's rabbinical ordination - published a stern proclamation declaring the illegitimacy of female rabbis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Not without irony, as Hillary Clinton wrapped up the democratic presidential nomination a group of leading American Orthodox rabbis opposed to women's ordination launched a series of "hearings" on this disputed subject.</seg>
<seg id="16">Why is there such disparity between the secular realm and the sacred?</seg>
<seg id="17">Orthodox Judaism, like most religions, seeks stability in what it considers enduring traditional values.</seg>
<seg id="18">This finds expression in resisting the pressure to conform to a changing society.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who oppose women's ordination do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."</seg>
<seg id="20">But the obsession with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost.</seg>
<seg id="21">And the cost of such single-mindedness can paradoxically be the undermining of tradition itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to remain vibrant.</seg>
<seg id="22">In The Guns of August, a military history of the First World War, Barbara Tuchman highlights the danger of prioritising tradition in what has become known as the "tragedy of the red trousers."</seg>
<seg id="23">In the lead up to WWI, as warfare shifted from fighting at close quarters to heavier artillery fired from greater distance, it become advantageous to conceal soldiers for as long as possible.</seg>
<seg id="24">The British and German armies reacted to this change by exchanging their bright coloured uniforms for drab greys and browns.</seg>
<seg id="25">The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red caps and trousers, marking them out as easy targets.</seg>
<seg id="26">The suggestion of the French war minister Adolphe Messimy that his armies do likewise was met with ridicule and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The red trousers represented army pride and prestige and military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up.</seg>
<seg id="28">At a parliamentary hearing, a former war minister, Eugene Etienne, spoke for France.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Eliminate the red trousers?" he cried.</seg>
<seg id="30">Never!</seg>
<seg id="31">"That blind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours," wrote Messimy afterwards, "was to have cruel consequences."</seg>
<seg id="32">Faith leaders grappling with women's inclusion in religious leadership roles are in danger of the same pitfall.</seg>
<seg id="33">By focusing exclusively on "what is traditional" for their religion rather than asking the crucial question: "What change is necessary for religion to thrive?" they risk alienating 50 per cent of their flock.</seg>
<seg id="34">They also deprive the entire community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise contribute.</seg>
<seg id="35">Insisting that men continue to wear the trousers when it comes to religion might be traditional, but, as the pantalon rouge debacle illustrates, it may not be worth the price.</seg>

<seg id="9">Her mission and mine is a week-long "luxury" boat and bike tour of Croatia's north Dalmatian coast and islands, organised by Freedom Treks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cycling at the height of summer in such a steeply pitched place as Croatia might not fit everyone's idea of luxury, but north Dalmatia is said to be an easier ride than south, our saddles are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in carefree and confident manner all those months ago there was a box we failed to tick that could have secured us the assistance of a battery-powered e-bike.</seg>
<seg id="11">The luxury part of the deal is our floating home for the week, the brand new Melody.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the end of the ride we can dump our bikes on the quay for our guides Ivan and Ivana to stow, and jump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mix it with sea urchins, sharp rocks and other people on the hanky sized strips of pebbles that Croatians call a beach.</seg>
<seg id="13">In late June the sea is a perfect temperature, all agree: cool enough to refresh, but not cold.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Melody is stocked with masks and snorkels and a couple of kayaks should anyone feel energetic after a hard morning in the saddle.</seg>
<seg id="15">Instead, most of us retreat to our air-conditioned cabins where Helena, the ship's masseuse - I'm not joking - will have made our beds, restocked our minibars and left a new box of chocs on the table.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ivan says stretching is important after cycling, and we practise stretching out for the afternoon on our beds or a cushioned lounger on the top deck with Antonio the barman ever ready to administer one of his cocktails.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Melody, at 42m long with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen shipmates, is no bulging superyacht but a stylish little cruiser.</seg>
<seg id="18">She turns heads in a small island port among the fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to her.</seg>
<seg id="19">Colleen and Patty belong to a meetup.com group of friends from Washington DC: the Over 45 Sport and Socials, they call themselves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Last year's barge and bike holiday in the Netherlands was such a success they decided to try something more adventurous and here they are in Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="21">A rival chapel of their church is doing a boat and bike holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the ether thickens with a ping pong rally of competitive Facebook postings.</seg>
<seg id="22">The adventure element of the holiday can be overstated, because our schedule is nothing if not regimented.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Breakfast and dinner are at eight o'clock," Ivan announced to the new intake at the welcome briefing as we set sail from the beautiful old port of Trogir, near Split.</seg>
<seg id="24">One ring of the ship's bell declares the buffet open and another at the end of the meal calls for silence and listen carefully to the next briefing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Good moaning!" is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the British contingent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who cares - the banter is well rehearsed and the jokes come thin and fast, while Ivana hands out sketch maps of the day's excursion and we all pretend to be horrified by the wiggles, contour shading and a profile with ups and downs on it, although anything else would be a surprise on a Croatian bike ride that starts and finishes at sea level.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.</seg>
<seg id="28">Completely flat is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ivan delivers his briefing in parallel text, switching fluently between English and German.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some weeks he has a dozen different nationalities to contend with, but we are an easy group - Swiss, German, American and British - which divides easily at mealtimes into two English speaking tables, one German.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the road we are all friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">Cycling breeds camaraderie, and the only competition is with the terrain, which is to say ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">I can't remember a more harmonious and relaxed group dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="34">We soon tune in to Ivan's wave length.</seg>
<seg id="35">A stiff climb is an incline, not to be confused with an undulation, which is a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hairpins are serpentines and straightforward means straight on: simple but not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="37">Cycling instructions are always the same: "Single file, keep your distance, and it's not a race.</seg>
<seg id="38">We meet on the quay at nine.</seg>
<seg id="39">OK, five past - you're on holiday, I forgot.</seg>
<seg id="40">Take lots of water.</seg>
<seg id="41">From Trogir our cruise takes us northwards for two days through the Kornati archipelago, where we ride most of the length of Dugi Otok - Croatian for "long island" - and have our slumbers interrupted for a walk in the Telašćica Nature Park, to admire its high cliffs and a salt lake fed by sea water through an underground channel.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is said to have rejuvenating power for all who swim in it.</seg>
<seg id="43">If we paddle, will our legs feel younger and stronger?</seg>
<seg id="44">At the small island of Molat we turn south again, hopping between mainland and nearby islands in seemingly haphazard fashion.</seg>
<seg id="45">Most of our rides are on empty little roads through open country with big sea views and mixed veg: olive groves, vineyards, prickly herbal scrub; Mediterranean scents in the air and myriad butterflies on the wing.</seg>
<seg id="46">While we roll along there is always a breeze but shade is at a premium when Ivan calls a halt, and small pools of it are the reward for early arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Sport and Socials do a lot of group cycling at weekends and they know the etiquette, sending warnings up and down the line and leaving gaps so that motorists can overtake more safely.</seg>
<seg id="48">"You were nearly a hood ornament there," one cyclist tells another, after a truck driver thought better of overtaking on a blind corner and hit the brakes hard.</seg>
<seg id="49">Fortunately they worked.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ivan divides us into three groups for the occasional short stretches of cycling on main roads, with Ivana at the very back to encourage and "scoop up," as Ivan puts it.</seg>
<seg id="51">And if a main road must be crossed we all assemble, dismount and walk our bikes to the safety of the other side, as instructed and not before.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Do you think Ivan realises he is not speaking to a group of children?" a Swiss cyclist asks, as we stand beside the road waiting for the signal to cross.</seg>
<seg id="53">Our afternoons are not all devoted to idleness.</seg>
<seg id="54">A city tour at Zadar reveals remains of a Roman forum and a sea organ which plays music like the moan of a caged sea monster, through pipes set in the stone fabric of the promenade and open to the water.</seg>
<seg id="55">Zadar's famous sunset is perfectly timed between main course and pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the play of wave-powered lights in a glass pavement - a dance floor, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="56">When Melody sets sail for the lively resort of Biograd in the early morning, the organ's song is no more than a whisper.</seg>
<seg id="57">Day five is entirely free of cycling.</seg>
<seg id="58">A boat trip up the Krka river estuary to visit its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of Sibenik with its domed cathedral, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; and a twilight stroll on the peaceful island of Zlarin in search of its local speciality, coral - make for an interesting day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lourdes prepares for pilgrims in shadow of attacks</seg>
<seg id="2">People gather during the annual Catholic pilgrimage at the sanctuary of Notre Dame de Lourdes.</seg>
<seg id="3">French security forces are on high alert as thousands of Catholics converge on the shrine of Lourdes for an annual pilgrimage unfolding in the shadow of a string of terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">Each year, tens of thousands flock to the sanctuary in the foothills of the Pyrenees for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, marking the ascent of the Virgin Mary into Heaven.</seg>
<seg id="5">This year's pilgrimage comes as Catholics reel from the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26 by two Islamist extremists, who stormed his church in northern France during Mass and slit his throat.</seg>
<seg id="6">Jacques Hamel's murder came under two weeks after a Tunisian -- said by investigators to have become radicalised by online jihadist videos -- ploughed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 85 people.</seg>
<seg id="7">Many in France are now leery about attending public gatherings after three large-scale attacks in 18 months.</seg>
<seg id="8">With tourist arrivals in the country plummeting, authorities had worried that the number of visitors to this year's pilgrimage would be sharply down.</seg>
<seg id="9">But fears of mass cancellations have failed to materialise -- and some organisers say there has even been a last-minute surge.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around 25,000 faithful are expected, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of around 200 members of the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many pilgrims say they will not be cowed.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We're not going to stop living," Christian, a 66-year-old visitor, told AFP, describing prayer as the "only weapon" in the face of violence.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's important to show that life goes on," said Matthieu Guignard, one of the coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's not because a few fanatics try to sow fear that we should abandon our faith, our beliefs, our way of living.</seg>
<seg id="15">Several major events have been cancelled in France since the Nice attack over security concerns, including a huge flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European road cycling championships that had been set to take place in Nice in September.</seg>
<seg id="16">"For the past week, my fear was that my phone would be ringing with cancellations," Fabien Lejeusne, the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage said last weekend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, the attacks appeared to mobilise the faithful, he said, reporting a last-minute bookings spurt.</seg>
<seg id="18">The head of the local hotel workers' union, Christian Gelis, confirmed signs of "increased interest" in the pilgrimage in the wake of the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="19">Security has been dramatically tightened around the sanctuary built around the shrine, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a grotto to Bernadette Soubirous, a poor shepherd girl, in 1858.</seg>
<seg id="20">Around 250 police and two dozen soldiers, including bomb disposal experts and officers with sniffer dogs, have been deployed to protect the area.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pilgrims filing through security barriers have their bags searched at the entrance to the site, where the number of access points has been reduced from a dozen to three.</seg>
<seg id="22">Catherine Simcox, who made a pilgrimage from the north east of England to Lourdes earlier this month described the heightened security.</seg>
<seg id="23">"By Thursday morning, there were armed guards inside the sanctuaries and then the gates became single file entry (with metal barriers) with bags being searched on the way in," she told The Local.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This total freaked my three kids out who are used to Lourdes & it was hard to not scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't spoil my experience, but it saddened me that it was necessary and I understood that some people were reassured by the measures.</seg>
<seg id="26">The route of Friday's opening procession has also been curtailed -- instead of starting in the town of Lourdes and proceeding to the sanctuary, it will start and end at the shrine.</seg>
<seg id="27">Other measures taken including shutting down the airspace above Lourdes to flights, closing off the streets around the sanctuary to traffic and replacing rubbish bins with transparent plastic bags.</seg>
<seg id="28">Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is to inspect security arrangements on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="29">Lourdes attracts around six million people a year, making it one of the biggest sites of Catholic pilgrimage in the world.</seg>
<seg id="30">Many visitors bring sick or disabled relatives, who come to bathe in a spring in the cave where Bernadette said she saw Mary, believing the water to have healing properties.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thierry Castillo, another of the organisers, described this year's gathering as "a bit unusual" given "the threat that seems to have taken root in France."</seg>
<seg id="32">But "it won't affect the quality and depth of what they experience," he assured.</seg>
<seg id="33">Francoise, a 58-year-old volunteer who was assisting sick pilgrims, admitted she found the presence of soldiers in fatigues "a little overwhelming."</seg>
<seg id="34">But if it reassures everyone, it's good.</seg>

<seg id="1">Turkey seeks missing diplomats following coup attempt</seg>
<seg id="2">Turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats who failed to return to Turkey in a recall of personnel following a July 15 coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Friday that 208 members of Turkey's ministry staff were recalled to Ankara from posts around the world in an inquiry regarding the coup attempt, and 32 remain missing "without permission."</seg>
<seg id="4">About 18,000 civil servants, military leaders and academics have been arrested or suspended from their positions in Turkey, the government believing their loyalties lie with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of masterminding the attempt to overthrow the government.</seg>
<seg id="5">Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on Turkey's most-wanted list.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cavosoglu said a U.S. Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.</seg>
<seg id="7">The issue has become a problem for the United States in its dealings with Turkey, a NATO member.</seg>
<seg id="8">The United States has objected to the strong-arm tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup, and Turkey has responded by attempting to develop closer ties with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cavosoglu said two Turkish military attaches in Greece fled to Italy, an attaché in Kuwait attempted to escape to Saudi Arabia but was sent back and two generals in Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">He added two civil servants in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one in Russia went to Japan.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, citing military sources, added Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was also missing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Wall Street Journal, citing a U.S. official familiar with the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer stationed at a Virginia NATO command center requested asylum in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are those who have escaped.</seg>
<seg id="14">There have been escapees among our diplomats as well," Cavosoglu told broadcaster NTV in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">As of yesterday, time has run out for those initially called back.</seg>
<seg id="16">We will carry out the legal operations for those who have not returned.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympic officials try to clean green-tinged diving pool</seg>
<seg id="2">Olympic divers planning to practice Friday arrived to a closed pool as officials took more time to clean the green-tinged water before holding the first individual event of the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The water suddenly changed color Tuesday, midway through the synchronized diving events.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials insisted the water was safe for competing, even after a larger, adjacent pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming also turned a lighter shade of green.</seg>
<seg id="5">The diving well was shut down when athletes arrived for morning warmups, though it did finally open at 1 p.m. local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the start of the women's 3-meter event.</seg>
<seg id="6">The water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shaded green.</seg>
<seg id="7">American diver Abby Johnston, who is competing on the springboard, said she showed up for her warmup, only to learn the pool was shut down without any notice.</seg>
<seg id="8">She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp" should start trending.</seg>
<seg id="9">British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in the synchro platform event, also commented on the state of the pool in a Twitter post.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hopefully that means we haven't been diving in anything too bad the last couple of days!</seg>
<seg id="11">Mario Andrada, chief spokesman for the local organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for competition, clearing the way for the 3-meter preliminaries.</seg>
<seg id="12">He conceded that some athletes were bothered by the water, but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We reiterate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any threat to the health of the athletes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the first day of this water situation, one or two athletes complained about their eyes being itchy.</seg>
<seg id="15">This was a result that the first reaction when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is very common in swimming pools.</seg>
<seg id="16">We reduced immediately the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="17">We retested the water and it was totally within the parameters.</seg>
<seg id="18">Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center, said the pool was closed to allow additional cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the decision was supported by world governing body FINA.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Andrada said officials were caught off guard by the pool's deteriorating condition.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Chemistry is not an exact science," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some things, as you can see, went longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rain the past couple of days made it even tougher to get the water color back to normal.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The rain doesn't help," Andrada said.</seg>
<seg id="26">He added that athletes had access to dry-land training in the morning, but conceded that "was not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="27">He explained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased alkaline levels, much like aquarium water can turn green when not monitored properly.</seg>
<seg id="28">When we went to fix the green, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.</seg>
<seg id="29">We can't use too much chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it," Andrada said.</seg>
<seg id="30">We certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning green.</seg>
<seg id="31">Once it turned green, we again made another bit of a mistake.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Thursday thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and wished for closer cooperation while meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</seg>
<seg id="3">China is an old friend of Uganda and Africa, who has sided with Africa during the continent's liberation from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development, Museveni said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The president cited the Tanzania-Zambia Railway built in the 1970s as an evidence of China's generous support even when China was by then not so prosperous itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">China has carried out multifaceted cooperation with Uganda, ranging from infrastructure and business investment to cultural exchanges, Museveni said, adding that such kind of cooperation is more conducive to Uganda's long-term development than simply providing aids.</seg>
<seg id="6">He hopes China can, through various ways, join in Uganda's infrastructural development and construction of industrial parks.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also welcomes more Chinese to invest and travel in Uganda.</seg>
