<seg id="2"> A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.  </seg>
<seg id="3"> But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."  </seg>
<seg id="4"> The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.  </seg>
<seg id="5"> The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.  </seg>
<seg id="6"> The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.  </seg>
<seg id="8"> "We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.  </seg>
<seg id="9"> Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.  </seg>
<seg id="10"> Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."  </seg>
<seg id="11"> "He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.  </seg>
<seg id="12"> Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> He was a kind spirit with a big heart.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.  </seg>
<seg id="15"> He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> He was the brother that went with the flow.  </seg>
<seg id="17"> "With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.  </seg>

<seg id="19"> Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action  </seg>
<seg id="20"> Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.  </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.  </seg>
<seg id="22"> The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.  </seg>
<seg id="23"> Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.  </seg>
<seg id="24"> It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.  </seg>
<seg id="26"> She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."  </seg>
<seg id="27"> In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.  </seg>
<seg id="28"> The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.  </seg>
<seg id="30"> He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.  </seg>
<seg id="31"> Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.  </seg>
<seg id="32"> Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?  </seg>
<seg id="33"> It was a gesture that ended a crisis.  </seg>
<seg id="34"> The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.  </seg>
<seg id="35"> But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.  </seg>
<seg id="36"> There was the handshake, yes.  </seg>
<seg id="37"> But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.  </seg>
<seg id="38"> Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.  </seg>
<seg id="39"> I lost count.  </seg>
<seg id="40"> He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.  </seg>
<seg id="41"> The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.  </seg>
<seg id="42"> To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.  </seg>
<seg id="43"> But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.  </seg>
<seg id="44"> In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.  </seg>
<seg id="45"> Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.  </seg>
<seg id="46"> Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.  </seg>
<seg id="47"> The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.  </seg>
<seg id="48"> Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.  </seg>
<seg id="49"> Russian public opinion has also turned since November.  </seg>
<seg id="50"> For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.  </seg>
<seg id="51"> All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.  </seg>
<seg id="52"> Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.  </seg>
<seg id="53"> He's denied that emphatically.  </seg>
<seg id="54"> But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.  </seg>
<seg id="55"> After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.  </seg>
<seg id="56"> Russia could claim a victory of sorts.  </seg>
<seg id="57"> For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.  </seg>
<seg id="58"> First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.  </seg>
<seg id="59"> Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.  </seg>
<seg id="60"> There is also an economic motive.  </seg>
<seg id="61"> Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.  </seg>
<seg id="62"> The number has slumped by almost 90%.  </seg>
<seg id="63"> As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.  </seg>
<seg id="64"> They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.  </seg>
<seg id="65"> And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.  </seg>
<seg id="66"> "Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.  </seg>
<seg id="67"> But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.  </seg>
<seg id="68"> Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.  </seg>
<seg id="69"> Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.  </seg>
<seg id="70"> The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.  </seg>
<seg id="71"> Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.  </seg>
<seg id="72"> So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.  </seg>
<seg id="73"> Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.  </seg>
<seg id="74"> The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.  </seg>
<seg id="75"> It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.  </seg>
<seg id="76"> Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.  </seg>
<seg id="77"> There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.  </seg>
<seg id="78"> But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.  </seg>
<seg id="79"> Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland  </seg>
<seg id="80"> The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.  </seg>
<seg id="81"> Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.  </seg>
<seg id="82"> Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.  </seg>
<seg id="83"> It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.  </seg>
<seg id="84"> During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.  </seg>
<seg id="85"> It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.  </seg>
<seg id="86"> But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.  </seg>
<seg id="87"> Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.  </seg>
<seg id="88"> In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.  </seg>
<seg id="89"> The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  </seg>
<seg id="90"> There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.  </seg>
<seg id="91"> Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.  </seg>
<seg id="92"> He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."  </seg>
<seg id="93"> As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.  </seg>
<seg id="94"> I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.  </seg>
<seg id="95"> Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.  </seg>
<seg id="96"> RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.  </seg>
<seg id="97"> "The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.  </seg>
<seg id="98"> It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.  </seg>
<seg id="99"> But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.  </seg>
<seg id="100"> We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.  </seg>
<seg id="101"> Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection  </seg>
<seg id="102"> Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins  </seg>
<seg id="103"> Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.  </seg>
<seg id="104"> He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.  </seg>
<seg id="105"> The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.  </seg>
<seg id="106"> He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.  </seg>
<seg id="107"> Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."  </seg>
<seg id="108"> I'm very emotional because my family are here as well  </seg>
<seg id="109"> I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.  </seg>
<seg id="110"> It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.  </seg>
<seg id="111"> I'm relieved and very humble.  </seg>
<seg id="112"> Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory  </seg>
<seg id="113"> Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.  </seg>
<seg id="114"> Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins  </seg>
<seg id="115"> Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.  </seg>
<seg id="116"> He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.  </seg>
<seg id="117"> He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.  </seg>
<seg id="118"> I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!  </seg>
<seg id="119"> Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.  </seg>
<seg id="120"> He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.  </seg>
<seg id="121"> Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount  </seg>
<seg id="122"> From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.  </seg>
<seg id="123"> It has been a rollercoaster ride.  </seg>
<seg id="124"> Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.  </seg>
<seg id="125"> Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.  </seg>
<seg id="126"> And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.  </seg>
<seg id="127"> Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov  </seg>
<seg id="128"> Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.  </seg>
<seg id="129"> Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.  </seg>
<seg id="130"> The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.  </seg>
<seg id="131"> A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.  </seg>
<seg id="132"> Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.  </seg>
<seg id="133"> Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.  </seg>
<seg id="134"> Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.  </seg>
<seg id="135"> Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).  </seg>
<seg id="136"> On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."  </seg>
<seg id="137"> I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.  </seg>
<seg id="138"> Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.  </seg>
<seg id="139"> Do the smiles convince?  </seg>
<seg id="140"> This is a move that has mystified Moscow.  </seg>
<seg id="141"> Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.  </seg>
<seg id="142"> As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.  </seg>
<seg id="143"> In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.  </seg>
<seg id="144"> But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.  </seg>
<seg id="145"> So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?  </seg>
<seg id="146"> No-one knows yet.  </seg>
<seg id="147"> But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.  </seg>
<seg id="148"> In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.  </seg>
<seg id="149"> Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.  </seg>
<seg id="150"> Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.  </seg>
<seg id="151"> He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.  </seg>
<seg id="152"> He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.  </seg>
<seg id="153"> In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.  </seg>
<seg id="154"> When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.  </seg>
<seg id="155"> It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.  </seg>
<seg id="156"> But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.  </seg>
<seg id="157"> Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.  </seg>

<seg id="159"> A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.  </seg>
<seg id="160"> Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.  </seg>
<seg id="161"> Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.  </seg>
<seg id="162"> Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife  </seg>
<seg id="163"> The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017  </seg>
<seg id="164"> Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.  </seg>
<seg id="165"> It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.  </seg>
<seg id="166"> The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.  </seg>
<seg id="167"> It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.  </seg>
<seg id="168"> The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.  </seg>
<seg id="169"> Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.  </seg>
<seg id="170"> He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.  </seg>
<seg id="171"> We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.  </seg>
<seg id="172"> Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.  </seg>
<seg id="173"> Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.  </seg>
<seg id="174"> Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.  </seg>
<seg id="175"> On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.  </seg>
<seg id="176"> After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.  </seg>
<seg id="177"> This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.  </seg>
<seg id="178"> This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.  </seg>
<seg id="179"> Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.  </seg>
<seg id="180"> Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.  </seg>
<seg id="181"> Happily, it all went very well.  </seg>
<seg id="182"> Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics  </seg>
<seg id="183"> Forget the pressure.  </seg>
<seg id="184"> Forget the hype.  </seg>
<seg id="185"> Simone Biles is immune to all of it.  </seg>
<seg id="186"> Dynamic on vault.  </seg>
<seg id="187"> Effortless on beam.  </seg>
<seg id="188"> Jaw-dropping on floor.  </seg>
<seg id="189"> Brilliant all over.  </seg>
<seg id="190"> And now, finally, an Olympic champion.  </seg>
<seg id="191"> The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.  </seg>
<seg id="192"> Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.  </seg>
<seg id="193"> United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.  </seg>
<seg id="194"> Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.  </seg>
<seg id="195"> She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.  </seg>
<seg id="196"> The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:  </seg>
<seg id="197"> Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."  </seg>
<seg id="198"> One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.  </seg>
<seg id="199"> Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.  </seg>
<seg id="200"> United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.  </seg>
<seg id="201"> Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.  </seg>
<seg id="202"> While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.  </seg>
<seg id="203"> A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.  </seg>
<seg id="204"> It's not a coincidence.  </seg>
<seg id="205"> The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.  </seg>
<seg id="206"> She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.  </seg>
<seg id="207"> Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.  </seg>
<seg id="208"> Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.  </seg>
<seg id="209"> She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.  </seg>
<seg id="210"> Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.  </seg>
<seg id="211"> Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.  </seg>
<seg id="212"> This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.  </seg>
<seg id="213"> She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.  </seg>
<seg id="214"> As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:  </seg>

<seg id="216"> Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.  </seg>
<seg id="217"> The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.  </seg>
<seg id="218"> The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.  </seg>
<seg id="219"> "He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.  </seg>
<seg id="220"> I just can't believe it.  </seg>
<seg id="221"> The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.  </seg>
<seg id="222"> Family tells the station he is expected to recover.  </seg>
<seg id="223"> He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.  </seg>
<seg id="224"> Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.  </seg>
<seg id="225"> Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.  </seg>
<seg id="226"> One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.  </seg>
<seg id="227"> The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.  </seg>
<seg id="228"> The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.  </seg>
<seg id="229"> Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.  </seg>
<seg id="230"> Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.  </seg>
<seg id="231"> It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.  </seg>
<seg id="232"> There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.  </seg>
<seg id="233"> So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.  </seg>
<seg id="234"> Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.  </seg>
<seg id="235"> No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.  </seg>
<seg id="236"> Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.  </seg>
<seg id="237"> She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.  </seg>
<seg id="238"> Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie  </seg>
<seg id="239"> That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.  </seg>
<seg id="240"> First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.  </seg>
<seg id="241"> And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.  </seg>
<seg id="242"> The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.  </seg>
<seg id="243"> This team looks, finally, like America.  </seg>
<seg id="244"> It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.  </seg>
<seg id="245"> For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.  </seg>
<seg id="246"> Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.  </seg>
<seg id="247"> This is powerful.  </seg>
<seg id="248"> Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.  </seg>
<seg id="249"> Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.  </seg>
<seg id="250"> On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.  </seg>
<seg id="251"> And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.  </seg>
<seg id="252"> We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.  </seg>
<seg id="253"> Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.  </seg>
<seg id="254"> They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.  </seg>
<seg id="255"> But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.  </seg>
<seg id="256"> Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.  </seg>
<seg id="257"> These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.  </seg>
<seg id="258"> Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.  </seg>
<seg id="259"> We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.  </seg>
<seg id="260"> I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.  </seg>
<seg id="261"> At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.  </seg>
<seg id="262"> In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.  </seg>
<seg id="263"> Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.  </seg>
<seg id="264"> This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.  </seg>
<seg id="265"> It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.  </seg>
<seg id="266"> To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.  </seg>
<seg id="267"> This is such an exciting time.  </seg>
<seg id="268"> Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.  </seg>
<seg id="269"> Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal  </seg>
<seg id="270"> Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.  </seg>
<seg id="271"> In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.  </seg>
<seg id="272"> The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.  </seg>
<seg id="273"> Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."  </seg>
<seg id="274"> With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.  </seg>
<seg id="275"> Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.  </seg>
<seg id="276"> This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.  </seg>
<seg id="277"> "Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.  </seg>
<seg id="278"> If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.  </seg>
<seg id="279"> The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.  </seg>
<seg id="280"> Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.  </seg>
<seg id="281"> The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.  </seg>
<seg id="282"> Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.  </seg>
<seg id="283"> Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."  </seg>
<seg id="284"> Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.  </seg>
<seg id="285"> Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.  </seg>
<seg id="286"> The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat  </seg>
<seg id="287"> Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.  </seg>
<seg id="288"> Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.  </seg>
<seg id="289"> The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.  </seg>
<seg id="290"> NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.  </seg>
<seg id="291"> But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.  </seg>
<seg id="292"> Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.  </seg>
<seg id="293"> Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.  </seg>
<seg id="294"> If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.  </seg>
<seg id="295"> And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.  </seg>
<seg id="296"> People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.  </seg>
<seg id="297"> Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.  </seg>
<seg id="298"> The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.  </seg>
<seg id="299"> Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."  </seg>
<seg id="300"> Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.  </seg>
<seg id="301"> The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.  </seg>
<seg id="302"> In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.  </seg>
<seg id="303"> Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.  </seg>
<seg id="304"> PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish  </seg>
<seg id="305"> Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report  </seg>
<seg id="306"> A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.  </seg>
<seg id="307"> Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."  </seg>
<seg id="308"> The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.  </seg>
<seg id="309"> He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.  </seg>
<seg id="310"> Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.  </seg>
<seg id="311"> The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.  </seg>
<seg id="312"> Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.  </seg>
<seg id="313"> He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.  </seg>
<seg id="314"> "This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.  </seg>
<seg id="315"> The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.  </seg>
<seg id="316"> Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.  </seg>
<seg id="317"> The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.  </seg>
<seg id="318"> Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."  </seg>
<seg id="319"> Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.  </seg>
<seg id="320"> Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.  </seg>
<seg id="321"> He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.  </seg>
<seg id="322"> Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are  </seg>
<seg id="323"> His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.  </seg>
<seg id="324"> "There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."  </seg>
<seg id="325"> Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."  </seg>
<seg id="326"> The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.  </seg>
<seg id="327"> Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.  </seg>
<seg id="328"> Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.  </seg>
<seg id="329"> Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.  </seg>
<seg id="330"> Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.  </seg>
<seg id="331"> Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.  </seg>
<seg id="332"> Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.  </seg>
<seg id="333"> Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.  </seg>
<seg id="334"> Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.  </seg>
<seg id="335"> Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).  </seg>
<seg id="336"> Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.  </seg>
<seg id="337"> Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.  </seg>
<seg id="338"> "The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.  </seg>
<seg id="339"> He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.  </seg>
<seg id="340"> He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.  </seg>
<seg id="341"> Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.  </seg>
<seg id="342"> Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.  </seg>
<seg id="343"> Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians  </seg>
<seg id="344"> Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.  </seg>
<seg id="345"> But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.  </seg>
<seg id="346"> So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.  </seg>
<seg id="347"> The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid  </seg>
<seg id="348"> Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.  </seg>
<seg id="349"> U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.  </seg>
<seg id="350"> And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.  </seg>
<seg id="351"> 'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.  </seg>
<seg id="352"> 'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'  </seg>
<seg id="353"> One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.  </seg>
<seg id="354"> Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.  </seg>
<seg id="355"> And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.  </seg>
<seg id="356"> Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor  </seg>
<seg id="357"> Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.  </seg>
<seg id="358"> Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'  </seg>
<seg id="359"> Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes  </seg>
<seg id="360"> Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest  </seg>
<seg id="361"> Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks  </seg>
<seg id="362"> One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'  </seg>
<seg id="363"> Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.  </seg>
<seg id="364"> Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.  </seg>
<seg id="365"> CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'  </seg>
<seg id="366"> Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday  </seg>
<seg id="367"> Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.  </seg>
<seg id="368"> Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.  </seg>
<seg id="369"> MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.  </seg>
<seg id="370"> Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.  </seg>
<seg id="371"> Thanks for that.  </seg>
<seg id="372"> Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.  </seg>
<seg id="373"> Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used  </seg>
<seg id="374"> Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????  </seg>
<seg id="375"> The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'  </seg>
<seg id="376"> Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'  </seg>
<seg id="377"> Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out  </seg>
<seg id="378"> Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being  </seg>
<seg id="379"> Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.  </seg>
<seg id="380"> You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.  </seg>
<seg id="381"> Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'  </seg>
<seg id="382"> It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'  </seg>
<seg id="383"> CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark  </seg>
<seg id="384"> Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf  </seg>
<seg id="385"> CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments  </seg>
<seg id="386"> The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.  </seg>
<seg id="387"> We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.  </seg>
<seg id="388"> We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.  </seg>
<seg id="389"> To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.  </seg>
<seg id="390"> That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.  </seg>
<seg id="391"> On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.  </seg>
<seg id="392"> 'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'  </seg>
<seg id="393"> 'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'  </seg>
<seg id="394"> 'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'  </seg>

<seg id="396"> Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.  </seg>
<seg id="397"> To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.  </seg>
<seg id="398"> She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.  </seg>
<seg id="399"> The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf  </seg>
<seg id="400"> A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'  </seg>
<seg id="401"> She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'  </seg>
<seg id="402"> Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.  </seg>
<seg id="403"> 'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'  </seg>
<seg id="404"> 'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'  </seg>
<seg id="405"> She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.  </seg>
<seg id="406"> 'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'  </seg>
<seg id="407"> Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'  </seg>
<seg id="408"> The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.  </seg>
<seg id="409"> Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'  </seg>

<seg id="413"> How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga  </seg>
<seg id="414"> It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.  </seg>
<seg id="415"> We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.  </seg>
<seg id="416"> Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.  </seg>
<seg id="417"> If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.  </seg>
<seg id="418"> You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.  </seg>
<seg id="419"> A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.  </seg>
<seg id="420"> For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.  </seg>
<seg id="421"> At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.  </seg>
<seg id="422"> Sounds tricky?  </seg>
<seg id="423"> Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.  </seg>
<seg id="424"> But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.  </seg>

<seg id="428"> After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.  </seg>
<seg id="429"> The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.  </seg>
<seg id="430"> The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation  </seg>
<seg id="431"> Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.  </seg>
<seg id="432"> She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.  </seg>
<seg id="433"> There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.  </seg>
<seg id="434"> This family are notorious and their name is notorious.  </seg>
<seg id="435"> The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.  </seg>
<seg id="436"> Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.  </seg>
<seg id="437"> Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished  </seg>
<seg id="438"> Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past  </seg>

<seg id="440"> Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.  </seg>
<seg id="441"> The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.  </seg>
<seg id="442"> One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'  </seg>
<seg id="443"> We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.  </seg>
<seg id="444"> The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.  </seg>
<seg id="445"> 'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'  </seg>
<seg id="446"> We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!  </seg>
<seg id="447"> It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.  </seg>
<seg id="448"> Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.  </seg>
<seg id="449"> The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property  </seg>
<seg id="450"> Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house  </seg>
<seg id="451"> He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.  </seg>
<seg id="452"> This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.  </seg>
<seg id="453"> I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.  </seg>
<seg id="454"> I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.  </seg>
<seg id="455"> Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.  </seg>
<seg id="456"> A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction  </seg>
<seg id="457"> Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house  </seg>
<seg id="458"> In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.  </seg>
<seg id="459"> Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.  </seg>
<seg id="460"> She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.  </seg>
<seg id="461"> After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.  </seg>
<seg id="462"> The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.  </seg>
<seg id="463"> Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies  </seg>
<seg id="464"> Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.  </seg>
<seg id="465"> 'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.  </seg>
<seg id="466"> Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.  </seg>

<seg id="468"> Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.  </seg>
<seg id="469"> Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.  </seg>
<seg id="470"> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.  </seg>
<seg id="471"> Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."  </seg>
<seg id="472"> A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.  </seg>
<seg id="473"> He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.  </seg>
<seg id="474"> Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  </seg>

<seg id="489"> French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp  </seg>
<seg id="490"> A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.  </seg>
<seg id="491"> At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.  </seg>
<seg id="492"> The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.  </seg>
<seg id="493"> Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.  </seg>
<seg id="494"> They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.  </seg>
<seg id="495"> A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."  </seg>
<seg id="496"> The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."  </seg>
<seg id="497"> He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.  </seg>
<seg id="498"> One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.  </seg>
<seg id="499"> More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.  </seg>

<seg id="525"> For example, the land development ratio of Jiangsu Province was up to 21% in 2015, ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China.  </seg>
<seg id="526"> Therefore, the problem of high pollution, heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles.  </seg>
<seg id="527"> On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment pressure is heavy.  </seg>

<seg id="537"> Qingdao is China's 12th and also Shandong's first trial city to use and trade emissions.  </seg>
<seg id="538"> On the 11th day of the month, many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Trading Center to submit emissions subscription. After acceptance, they shall pay fees.  </seg>
<seg id="539"> The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot officially kicked off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.  </seg>
<seg id="540"> In the morning of 11th day of the month, Zhao Xiuping, the General Manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd. came to the trading center to submit emissions subscription.  </seg>
<seg id="541"> Its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason.  </seg>
<seg id="542"> After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report, etc., Qingdao Municipal Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials.  </seg>
<seg id="543"> According to the collection standard determined by Qingdao price bureau and financial sector, the estimated initial emission fee is about 641,200 yuan. The working staff will finish review within 7 working days.  </seg>
<seg id="544"> The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot will officially kick off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.  </seg>
<seg id="545"> According to Zhao Xiuping, up to RMB 400 million has been invested in the current environmental protection. Such investment has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up a space for the enterprise innovation management.  </seg>

<seg id="548"> The paid use and trading of Air Pollutant Emission Permits cover the city's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat.  </seg>
<seg id="549"> On January 1, 2016, the current pollutant discharging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exempt from expenditure of compensated use.  </seg>
<seg id="550"> The obtaining of compensated emission right is not equal to the obtaining of illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will.  </seg>
<seg id="551"> Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, introduces that companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. Illegal enterprises cannot be allowed to circumvent punishment via purchasing emission rights.  </seg>
<seg id="552"> In other words, we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises' over standard discharge behaviors, so as to protect the environment and public health.  </seg>
<seg id="553"> Now for their own interests, enterprises have raised their enthusiasm of pollution control, cherished limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollutants.  </seg>
<seg id="554"> With the economic interests drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health.  </seg>
<seg id="555"> Emission right, also known as "dumping right", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government.  </seg>
<seg id="556"> This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.  </seg>
<seg id="557"> Next, under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, the internal resources of pollution began to swap discharge capacities via currency exchange.  </seg>
<seg id="558"> Since the proposition of emissions trading by American economist Dyers in 1968, it has been applied by the United States of America to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s.  </seg>

<seg id="606"> The ordinary farmer has a daughter, named Zhang Binbin. She is the one to win sanzi final silver medal of Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle games for China in the evening of the eleventh.  </seg>
<seg id="607"> In the evening of the 11th day of the month, just in front of this new TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning.  </seg>
<seg id="608"> At the game, Zhang Binbin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final.  </seg>
<seg id="609"> But her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game. Zhang Binbin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers broke out in her home.  </seg>
<seg id="610"> In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion.  </seg>
<seg id="611"> This year, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, in the 16-year shooting career, has actually missed the silver medal for several times.  </seg>
<seg id="612"> According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, her daughter sent a few "little persuaders" from her village at their hesitation.  </seg>
<seg id="613"> These little persuaders are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.  </seg>
<seg id="614"> Just after coming to Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang'an school because of her family difficulties.  </seg>
<seg id="615"> But after the repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen team.  </seg>
<seg id="616"> And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time.  </seg>
<seg id="617"> This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coach of Xiamen shooting archery sports center and Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team.  </seg>
<seg id="618"> Just at yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals of the shooting with her insistence.  </seg>
<seg id="619"> "Each coach has his own method to choose the potential player. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands."  </seg>
<seg id="620"> Zhang Donghong also recalled, in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, her rings were very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.  </seg>
<seg id="621"> During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most.  </seg>
<seg id="622"> He recalled that after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team carried out a long shot of gun training, requiring players not to move for half an hour.  </seg>
<seg id="623"> Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobby of painting and producing toys.  </seg>
<seg id="624"> "I used to make clothes and do some sowing jobs. Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls."  </seg>
<seg id="625"> She said, her daughter often sewed hand toys. Plus, she is good at painting and could make animated toys from the doll's facial features to clothing.  </seg>
<seg id="626"> As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are separate more than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time.  </seg>
<seg id="627"> According to her parents, no matter meeting in person or talking by phone, Zhang Binbin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things.  </seg>
<seg id="628"> Because they cannot often see their daughter, they put away the paintings of her childhood and honors of consecutive years.  </seg>
<seg id="629"> Zhang Xiaolong showed the animation show of her daughter to the reporter, "She should keep drawing instead if she did not become shooter."  </seg>
<seg id="630"> In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates.  </seg>
<seg id="631"> Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. "This is honor made by Binbin after a dozen of years' efforts. We feel quite cherished."  </seg>
<seg id="632"> Recently, Hebei Cixiao Fund sent a 16,000-yuan relief sent to six families who lost their relatives in Xiaozuo, Taitou and Guiquan Village of Jinjing County.  </seg>
<seg id="633"> This is another condolence and care activity after the fund association releases the call for finding "bereaved children and lonely old men causued by the flood disaster in July 19, 2016".  </seg>
<seg id="634"> The 719 heavy rainfall caused heavy disaster to many cities of Hebei Province and resulted in the flood disaster of some regions in Hebei province. During the period, some people were dead and missing.  </seg>
<seg id="635"> The good man "Lao Tie" sacrificed his life when he helped the community on drainage, leaving a 2-year-old kid and a wife with child. The moving story of the good man "Lao Tie" made the entire provincial capital moved.  </seg>
<seg id="636"> On August 4, the working personnel of Hebei Provincial Cixiao Fund and volunteers of Hebei Brand Association came to his home and offered his relatives with 3,200-yuan love donation.  </seg>
<seg id="637"> When Ye Li, the vice president of Hebei Brand Association acknowledged the situation of "Lao Tie", they immediately decided to carry out "love charity" activities among enterprise members to help "old iron" family to ride out the storm.  </seg>

<seg id="639"> According to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12, the current diamond sales in Mainland China were accused of three major problems, including the false marking of diamond clarity to raise sales price, false diamond weight and unguaranteed aftersales, etc.  </seg>
<seg id="640"> Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well-known. All diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification, deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies.  </seg>
<seg id="641"> "A small cloth bag, holding in one's hand, such light-weighted, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told of her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media.  </seg>
<seg id="642"> She buried the diamond in her lingerie and carried it all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath.  </seg>
<seg id="643"> She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was retail-priced about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men.  </seg>
<seg id="644"> Recently, she sold the diamond with 120% more than the price she bought and earned two hundred thousand yuan.  </seg>
<seg id="645"> According to the provisions of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamond should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, it shall be classified as smuggling. People may be sentenced to jail.  </seg>
<seg id="646"> According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place.  </seg>
<seg id="647"> According to some media, after the British referendum off Europe, the new British Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation on the "neutral country", Swiss on the European continent. This is symbolic.  </seg>
<seg id="648"> The British "Guardian" commented that the symbolic neutrality nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort.  </seg>
<seg id="649"> British "Daily Telegraph" commented that Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that the British Prime Minister chose to go vacation in Swiss after Margaret Thatcher.  </seg>
<seg id="650"> The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the hot place which Blair and Cameron, the two male prime ministers like to go to.  </seg>
<seg id="651"> It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to London on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.  </seg>
<seg id="652"> The British parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required by the internet.  </seg>
<seg id="653"> On June 23, the British held a referendum for Brexit, but the British new prime minister did not want to start the article 50, which is involved with the Lisbon Treaty before the end of the year.  </seg>
<seg id="654"> There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its number and quantity ranked first in Anhui province.  </seg>
<seg id="655"> As the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage projects of Anhui province mainly relies on oral and face-to-face passage, many intangible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations. So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative.  </seg>
<seg id="656"> According to the work plan of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress this year, the Standing Committee plans to listen to the deliberation of special work report, and carry out the implementation of banking supervision and management law and special inquiry of serving local economic development.  </seg>
<seg id="657"> In mid-August, the Standing Committee will organize two research groups to conduct research in some cities to prepare for the special inquiry.  </seg>
<seg id="658"> Hua Jianhui pointed out that this was the first time that the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress listened to and deliberated on the special work report of vertical administration department and carry out special inquiries. It is the active exploration for enhancing and exploring the supervision work of the Provincial People's Congress.  </seg>

<seg id="660"> China's Mars program is coming  </seg>
<seg id="661"> China Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries.  </seg>
<seg id="662"> China's Mars exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such task has considerable difficulty.  </seg>
<seg id="663"> Because the Mars probe can encounter a time window in 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020.  </seg>
<seg id="664"> According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration. The detection of Mars means that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense.  </seg>
<seg id="665"> "Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."  </seg>
<seg id="666"> "Taking into account the mass of Mars detectors, it will be the job of China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission."  </seg>
<seg id="667"> China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries. There was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries, but the landing failed.  </seg>
<seg id="668"> Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector.  </seg>
<seg id="669"> In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles.  </seg>
<seg id="670"> According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is because Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings.  </seg>
<seg id="671"> Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.  </seg>
<seg id="672"> Therefore, the human beings hope that one day on the Mars to establish a base of residence, and ultimately to Mars immigration, it turned into a second home of mankind.  </seg>
<seg id="673"> A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin, low temperature, water depletion and so on.  </seg>
<seg id="674"> Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second Mars which is difficult for human beings to inhabit.  </seg>
<seg id="675"> As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions.  </seg>
<seg id="676"> However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted.  </seg>
<seg id="677"> There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work.  </seg>
<seg id="678"> World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection.  </seg>
<seg id="679"> On Nov. 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangalian", and has become Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars.  </seg>
<seg id="680"> "Mangalian" is used to study the surface, the atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars.  </seg>
<seg id="681"> The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration.  </seg>
<seg id="682"> According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges.  </seg>
<seg id="683"> The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty.  </seg>
<seg id="684"> Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics.  </seg>
<seg id="685"> A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover and let it wait patiently until the disappearance of dust storms.  </seg>
<seg id="686"> At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection.  </seg>
<seg id="687"> This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger, and need to constantly adjust, and strive to align with the sun direction.  </seg>
<seg id="688"> In addition, since the gravity of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power.  </seg>
<seg id="689"> "The core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success."  </seg>
<seg id="690"> According to Sun Ze, it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large.  </seg>
<seg id="691"> Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.  </seg>
<seg id="692"> Pang Zhihao said, in general, the way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars.  </seg>
<seg id="693"> Because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the Mars detection.  </seg>
<seg id="694"> According to Taiwanese media reports, Lin Quan, the head of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced yesterday morning, "Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations" will take effective since today.  </seg>
<seg id="695"> KMT Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said, "Kuomintang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility."  </seg>
<seg id="696"> Lin Quan stressed that if the political party, accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban, the Commission will investigate and punish "according to the law".  </seg>
<seg id="697"> Lin Quan also announced that Hong Peigen, "Deputy Director of the Independent", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.  </seg>
<seg id="698"> He said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations. The experience of Hong Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related Ill-gotten Party Assets.  </seg>
<seg id="699"> Zhan Qixian said that, as long as there are party assets today, no one will give you social donations. So if the party were all confiscated away, then Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "You will have chance to go when there are no assets."  </seg>
<seg id="700"> Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch.  </seg>
<seg id="701"> Original title: Suit launched by "corridor doctor" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV host Wang Zhi'an for reputation infringement fails in instance judgment  </seg>
<seg id="702"> The legal evening news: Because the CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the "corridor doctor" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.  </seg>
<seg id="703"> Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court sentenced the case and the verdict said that Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims.  </seg>
<seg id="704"> At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhi'an found after his survey that although Lan Yuefeng was sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information.  </seg>
<seg id="705"> On March 29, 2014, the "corridor doctor" program produced by CCTV news survey broadcasted.  </seg>
<seg id="706"> All information about the so-called over-medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.  </seg>
<seg id="707"> In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is because of his stubborn characters and paranoid personality".  </seg>
<seg id="708"> Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging and apologized to him and made compensation of 100,000 yuan for the mental damage solatium.  </seg>
<seg id="709"> At the time of the trial, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng.  </seg>
<seg id="710"> Highlight of the 12th day of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games  </seg>
<seg id="711"> The bicycle game is expected to realize the "zero breakthrough" in the Olympic gold medal while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four.  </seg>
<seg id="712"> Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the two races. He won silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May.  </seg>
<seg id="713"> According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, the 27-year-old Korean archery female player won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is the second scoring of Olympic gold medal following the team competition. This made she become a double winner.  </seg>
<seg id="714"> Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium.  </seg>
<seg id="715"> Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  </seg>
<seg id="716"> She did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She won the first individual tournament gold medal when she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer.  </seg>
<seg id="717"> Zhang Huizhen recalled, "My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition.  </seg>
<seg id="718"> Zhang Huizhen was ranked the fourth at the London Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and can just watch her colleague and good friend Qi Pubei score two gold medals.  </seg>
<seg id="719"> Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. "I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."  </seg>
<seg id="720"> The 28-year-old Korean archery "No.1", and the London Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner Qi Fubei won the bronze medal.  </seg>
<seg id="721"> Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.  </seg>
<seg id="722"> Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the blonde medal. At this time, we can know her pressure.  </seg>
<seg id="723"> Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it needs scientific training, which should be accumulated over time.  </seg>
<seg id="724"> The Archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through the cemetery during night.  </seg>
<seg id="725"> Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really be launched into the market.  </seg>
<seg id="726"> Although Apple did not respond, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 "real machine model" on the internet.  </seg>
<seg id="727"> The new generation of iPhone is really "eye-catching", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine product at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.  </seg>
<seg id="728"> This has exacerbated people's disappointment of the new iPhone, "It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation of iPhone is so terrible."  </seg>
<seg id="729"> iPhone7, just like other iPhones, brings countless secret before birth.  </seg>
<seg id="730"> In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.  </seg>
<seg id="731"> Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface.  </seg>
<seg id="732"> Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.  </seg>
<seg id="733"> Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn conference.  </seg>
<seg id="734"> But this does not prevent the industry insiders to be optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree.  </seg>
<seg id="735"> Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of "buying" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement.  </seg>
<seg id="736"> Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7.  </seg>
<seg id="737"> 7% of respondents said they have the plan to buy iPhone7, while only 4% people had the plan to buy iPhone6.  </seg>
<seg id="738"> It is understood that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a quite high proportion.  </seg>
<seg id="739"> Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhone mobile phone.  </seg>
<seg id="740"> According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for 2 years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for 2 years.  </seg>
<seg id="741"> According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. "The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."  </seg>
<seg id="742"> Supply and demand contradiction will affect the average user, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time.  </seg>
<seg id="743"> According to informed sources, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, with the purpose to prepare adequate supply.  </seg>
<seg id="744"> Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will inevitably bring to users.  </seg>
<seg id="745"> "With the lowest price, the consumer may "buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day".  </seg>
<seg id="746"> Adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying. Suning's logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience.  </seg>
<seg id="747"> Maybe you'll get a call at midnight. "Hello, Suning Tesco, your iPhone7 is here."  </seg>
<seg id="748"> The organizers hope that the local people can understand more about the history of Chinese culture via the cultural relics exhibition, thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.  </seg>

<seg id="756"> According to foreign media reports, the "green pool" incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green.  </seg>
<seg id="757"> However, on the morning of the 10th day of the month, the water of the match pool adjacent to the water pool also turned green.  </seg>
<seg id="758"> Australian water polo contestant said that his eyes feel tingling and would like to shed tears.  </seg>
<seg id="759"> Previously, Rio officials confirmed the situation of water greening, and said the water color is due to the weakening of alkaline reasons and will not affect the athlete's health.  </seg>
<seg id="760"> However, after Australian players achieved success with the Japanese delegation in the water polo pool, they said their eyes felt pricking.  </seg>
<seg id="761"> When the water of diving pool turned green, the hosting party worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problems in the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool in the morning of the 10th day of the month.  </seg>
<seg id="762"> During the competition period of the Australia and Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually worsened, but the official stressed that they would manage to return the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th day of the month.  </seg>
<seg id="763"> Mario Andrada, the spokesman of Rio Olympic Games said, "The alkalinity of water quality in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon".  </seg>

<seg id="785"> On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.  </seg>
<seg id="786"> Sheng Yunyun, spokesman of National Bureau of Statistics and head of National Economic Statistics Division said that, in July, the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range.  </seg>
<seg id="787"> According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July have come down.  </seg>
<seg id="788"> Sheng Laiyun said, as for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of Premier, "the shape is volatile and the potential is still good". This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.  </seg>
<seg id="789"> He explained that "the shape of the fluctuations" refers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in July.  </seg>
<seg id="790"> In July, the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively heavy.  </seg>
<seg id="791"> As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, adjustment labor pains are releasing and the economy is under great pressure, so some indicators are still fluctuating.  </seg>
<seg id="792"> Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there was a special case in July, with serious floods, high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas.  </seg>
<seg id="793"> According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan.  </seg>
<seg id="794"> From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.  </seg>
<seg id="795"> The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic.  </seg>
<seg id="796"> From these factors, it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators. And such thing is expected.  </seg>
<seg id="797"> He said, "The potential is still good" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed.  </seg>
<seg id="798"> In July, CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation is stable.  </seg>
<seg id="799"> According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.  </seg>
<seg id="800"> At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance based on the count of high-temperature working days.  </seg>
<seg id="801"> In case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people are released with the allowance of not less than 15 yuan.  </seg>
<seg id="802"> In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance).  </seg>
<seg id="803"> In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 330 yuan. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance.  </seg>
<seg id="804"> In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation.  </seg>
<seg id="805"> Employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather.  </seg>
<seg id="806"> The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint.  </seg>
<seg id="807"> If the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above.  </seg>
<seg id="808"> At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted.  </seg>
<seg id="809"> So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks.  </seg>
<seg id="810"> The newly built Urumqi station is located in Urumqi high-speed rail area, with the whole construction area of around 100,000 square meters.  </seg>

<seg id="820"> Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest.  </seg>
<seg id="821"> In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known.  </seg>
<seg id="822"> At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak.  </seg>
<seg id="823"> This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.  </seg>
<seg id="824"> This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its moving into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends.  </seg>
<seg id="825"> The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak.  </seg>
<seg id="826"> In order to remind people that it has suffered damage, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but to retain the original white color of the 3D print material.  </seg>
<seg id="827"> The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bone to support.  </seg>
<seg id="828"> Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.  </seg>
<seg id="829"> Animal rescue center, ornithologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several "test beak" for Gracia and finally built a "perfect beak" for it.  </seg>
<seg id="830"> Now Gracia has been able to use the new beak to drink water, eat, and even peck fine grains.  </seg>
<seg id="831"> "The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it."  </seg>
<seg id="832"> "3D printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life." Thomas Lange, the chairman of US SG3D printing company said in an interview with Xinhua International.  </seg>
<seg id="833"> In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body.  </seg>
<seg id="834"> At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.  </seg>
<seg id="835"> After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there are a tide of animal anti-abuse call occurring inside and outside Costa Rica.  </seg>
<seg id="836"> People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against abusers.  </seg>
<seg id="837"> People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting.  </seg>
<seg id="838"> Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, is also involved in the design of the Gracia beak.  </seg>
<seg id="839"> "The situation of Gracia is very special, and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 centimeter, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."  </seg>
<seg id="840"> "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its beak and fixed on its beak with glue."  </seg>
<seg id="841"> "This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia," Lange told Xinhua International.  </seg>
<seg id="842"> Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection.  </seg>
<seg id="843"> Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman.  </seg>
<seg id="844"> They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel.  </seg>
<seg id="845"> The documentary "The State of the Toucan" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals.  </seg>
<seg id="846"> Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.  </seg>
<seg id="847"> August 12 report on Cankaoxiaoxi website: Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn."  </seg>
<seg id="848"> Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.  </seg>
<seg id="849"> China's oil products are gradually close to Japan's oil products because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations.  </seg>
<seg id="850"> Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, "teapot refinery" generally refines oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia.  </seg>
<seg id="851"> The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution.  </seg>
<seg id="852"> After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refinery" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur content and improved petroleum products.  </seg>
<seg id="853"> East Fuel General Oil Company said, "With China's domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve, the refining capacity of the equipment also increased.  </seg>
<seg id="854"> As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually rivalled that of Japan (the world's highest quality).  </seg>
<seg id="855"> According to JX Energy, "After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia." Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market.  </seg>
<seg id="856"> Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market".  </seg>
<seg id="857"> As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refinery got more attentions.  </seg>

<seg id="885"> UV not only tans your skin but also sunburns it, so how to make the skin go through the military training, without sunburn?  </seg>
<seg id="886"> Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF index includes 15, 30, 50, etc.  </seg>
<seg id="887"> The product marked with PA is for UVA, so that sunblock will play a more effective role. Usually, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time.  </seg>
<seg id="888"> Water-based sunblock with a strong penetration is often applied to oily skin. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.  </seg>
<seg id="889"> Creamy sunscreen is often applied to dry skin. The classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.  </seg>
<seg id="890"> Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to completely penetrate into the skin.  </seg>
<seg id="891"> Because you are exposed to sun longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect. So keep doing it.  </seg>
<seg id="892"> As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training.  </seg>
<seg id="893"> After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed.  </seg>

<seg id="900"> During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go further.  </seg>
<seg id="901"> According to the report of Popular Science, an American monthly website, on August 11, the US Air Force was interested in copying this effect.  </seg>
<seg id="902"> Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, but this may not be the interest of the US Air Force.  </seg>
<seg id="903"> Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm.  </seg>
<seg id="904"> The final goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.  </seg>

<seg id="906"> Industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons.  </seg>
<seg id="907"> Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity.  </seg>
<seg id="908"> Although the first four notices are not directly involved with coal industry, the target industry is directly related with coal industry.  </seg>
<seg id="909"> From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5500 kcal steam coal lingers at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into a loss.  </seg>
<seg id="910"> And since February, coal prices gradually picked up, Qinhuangdao steam coal prices rose continuously for four weeks, rose to 16 months high, once climbed to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly 70 yuan per ton over the beginning.  </seg>
<seg id="911"> With the price rising, come along the concerns of various industries: will a number of small coal mines resume production?  </seg>
<seg id="912"> In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation.  </seg>
<seg id="913"> Kuang Xianming: overcapacity cut roused the high concerns to various industries. The report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed.  </seg>
<seg id="914"> These three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed.  </seg>
<seg id="915"> Second, it is also directly related with the force of local government. During the overcapacity cut process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions.  </seg>
<seg id="916"> Thirdly, some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year.  </seg>
<seg id="917"> In this case, relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact.  </seg>
<seg id="918"> First, the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control.  </seg>
<seg id="919"> Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry.  </seg>
<seg id="920"> During the process of overcapacity cut deploying, the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry.  </seg>
<seg id="921"> Second, in order to complete this year's overcapacity cut task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision.  </seg>
<seg id="922"> Finally, we should strengthen the role of social security.  </seg>
<seg id="923"> Because the market is directly related to the employment problem, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees.  </seg>

<seg id="938"> The two tributaries will conduct construction via social financing. The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments.  </seg>
<seg id="939"> The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 32.5 km.  </seg>
<seg id="940"> According to the navigation needs, the old Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation. Dredging was conducted on the local depth and curve cut-off on the local sharp bend. Then the navigation conditions can be improved.  </seg>
<seg id="941"> The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng area and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 19 km.  </seg>
<seg id="942"> The renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011. The delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015. The investment construction and operation main body is Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.  </seg>
<seg id="943"> In accordance with the "loan construction and charging for repaying loan" principle, Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.  </seg>
<seg id="944"> Among them, the basic toll is 1.75 yuan/dwt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan/km dwt.  </seg>
<seg id="945"> The toll collection date is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.  </seg>
<seg id="946"> Reporters learned from Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within Jining territory, including Zhushuihe Channel, Baima River Channel, Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel.  </seg>
<seg id="947"> These four channels are Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal tributary channels, which are upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing.  </seg>
<seg id="948"> Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the mode of "government + market" for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong province. The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund supplements the funding gap.  </seg>
<seg id="949"> Baima River, the laowanfu River and Beidaliu River and other feeder routes adopt pure market operation.  </seg>
<seg id="950"> The funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade.  </seg>
<seg id="951"> Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding.  </seg>
<seg id="952"> Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.  </seg>
<seg id="953"> May be in the 50-meter freestyle preliminaries, Ningze Tao once again refreshed the people's "bottom line."  </seg>
<seg id="954"> Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the subject of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project.  </seg>
<seg id="955"> Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming.  </seg>
<seg id="956"> Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.  </seg>
<seg id="957"> After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao instantly become celebrity with his good look and excellent performance.  </seg>
<seg id="958"> As a result, "national husband (a good match)", "fresh little meat", "gorgeous", etc. have become his label.  </seg>
<seg id="959"> A variety of business activities came to him. He really have a golden flashing prospect.  </seg>
<seg id="960"> In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.  </seg>
<seg id="961"> After all, he is only 23 years old. After a certain degree of study, he can perform some TV series with his popularity.  </seg>
<seg id="962"> But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors.  </seg>
<seg id="963"> At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of athlete career.  </seg>
<seg id="964"> The beautiful appearance of Liu Xuan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle.  </seg>
<seg id="965"> After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and in 2013 she set up her own studio.  </seg>
<seg id="966"> Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.  </seg>
<seg id="967"> But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the single 10-meter match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team.  </seg>
<seg id="968"> But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show "Dad, Where Are We Going?", he became a focus.  </seg>
<seg id="969"> The once gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in a variety of variety show.  </seg>
<seg id="970"> It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King.  </seg>
<seg id="971"> And Chen Yibing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.  </seg>
<seg id="972"> But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the London Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs.  </seg>
<seg id="973"> However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show.  </seg>
<seg id="974"> However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle.  </seg>
<seg id="975"> After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection.  </seg>
<seg id="976"> Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them.  </seg>
<seg id="977"> And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.  </seg>
<seg id="978"> Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great.  </seg>
<seg id="979"> Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image.  </seg>
<seg id="980"> After all, at the mention of athletes, people's requirements on athletes are "not seeking victory but for no fear of danger". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point.  </seg>
<seg id="981"> At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans.  </seg>
<seg id="982"> It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.  </seg>
<seg id="983"> You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious.  </seg>
<seg id="984"> On the surface, the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness.  </seg>

<seg id="988"> "Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."  </seg>
<seg id="989"> Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more equal dialogue, avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat.  </seg>
<seg id="990"> New comers in the company love online exchange with colleagues. "We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. The likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another. "  </seg>
<seg id="991"> People who love to make friends also love online communication. "I lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings. We became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting."  </seg>
<seg id="992"> IT engineer Wu Yan is a profound social networking lovers. His majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of offline friends.  </seg>
<seg id="993"> Wu Yan himself admitted that the network is more "in his element".  </seg>
<seg id="994"> "You can respond to your friends when you are willing, because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly.  </seg>
<seg id="995"> "The communication hidden below one's ID can avoid interpersonal clash. This not only has room for maneuver, and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds."  </seg>
<seg id="996"> "People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech. Various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet."  </seg>
<seg id="997"> However, Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, thought that Wu Yan is a "very boring otaku."  </seg>
<seg id="998"> Xiaopeng and Wuyan meet each other in the group chatting. They two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers.  </seg>
<seg id="999"> Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet. He is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views. His words are repeated like this, "Oh, yes, right", or "I will check it online".  </seg>

<seg id="1107"> Sun Fujian is a Party cadre, but he lost his ideal and belief by violently breaking the discipline of the Party after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In addition, he is not astringent and breaks the rules. Such deed is vile and grave indeed.  </seg>
<seg id="1108"> After the occurrence of this case and a number of media reports, this has become the focus of the case, with extremely bad social impact.  </seg>
<seg id="1109"> After the case, Haikou City Public Security Bureau of Interpol detachment leaders attach great importance and immediately organize a detachment of elite troops to take the initiative to investigate.  </seg>
<seg id="1110"> The police immediately pursued and attacked the suspect on the internet and took a variety of measures to control. In addition, the police contacted their colleagues of other cities to investigate the whereabouts of Wang.  </seg>

<seg id="1112"> Greenland sharks are also known as small head sleeping sharks, widely distributed in Greenland and the North Atlantic waters around Iceland. It has the length of 4 to 5 meters in their adult age.  </seg>
<seg id="1113"> But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm a year, suggesting that Greenland shark may have an extra-long life.  </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Traditional dating methods usually use calcified tissue of animals. Some fins can use fins, but this calcified tissue is very scarce in Greenland sharks.  </seg>
<seg id="1115"> A new study led by Julius Nelson of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, turned to the use of Greenland shark's ocular lens for radioactive carbon dating.  </seg>
<seg id="1116"> This method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time to be used to determine the age of sharks and other fish.  </seg>
<seg id="1117"> Their analysis showed that the life span of the largest shark is estimated at 392 years old, with the error of 120 years old.  </seg>
<seg id="1118"> That is to say, this shark is aged at least 272 years old. The maximum age may be 512 years old.  </seg>
<seg id="1119"> In addition, the female Greenland shark is alleged to be sexually matured at about 4 meters in length. That is, it can only reach adulthood at least until the age of 156.  </seg>
<seg id="1120"> The researchers thus wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark was known as the vertebrate with the longest life span on the Earth, surpassing the age of the previous longevity champion black right whale (211 years).  </seg>

<seg id="1139"> In late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will go to Kenya to attend the 6th African Development Conference, according to the Evening News Peak of Voice of China.  </seg>
<seg id="1140"> The African Development Conference was dominated by Japan, and the previous five meetings were held in Tokyo, Japan or Yokohama, so this meeting will be the first move to Africa.  </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the meeting held in Africa will help to attract attentions of African and European countries to Japan.  </seg>
<seg id="1142"> In line with the trip of Shinzo Abe, according to Kyodo news agency, the Japanese Liberal Democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned.  </seg>
<seg id="1143"> Japan's "application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council" began in the early 90s of the last century while the African-sponsored African Development Conference also began in 1993. This is not a coincidence.  </seg>
<seg id="1144"> Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations and is therefore an important ticket bunker of the United Nation. How can Japan give up Africa if it wanted to join the United Nations Security Council?  </seg>
<seg id="1145"> It will also exchange views with national stakeholders on the extreme organization of "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.  </seg>
<seg id="1146"> "Western Group" will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea Bissau.  </seg>

<seg id="1148"> Abe has announced here that in order to stabilize the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, it will provide 100 billion yen (about RMB 6.1 billion) in five years.  </seg>
<seg id="1149"> Observers generally believe that there are two purposes behind Japan's generosity toward Africa: first, to increase Japan's presence in Africa; second, to win the support of African countries on the application to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.  </seg>
<seg id="1150"> "In terms of politics, Africa is relatively lagging behind, but there are many African countries. So Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big ticket field,'" said Yang Bojiang, an expert for Japanese issues.  </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Japan will not give up in the future and its work on Africa will not be terminated but gradually strengthened.  </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Economically, Japan enjoys a strong production capacity, but its domestic market is relatively limited. In particular, the domestic demand is relatively weak in the context of aging population.  </seg>
<seg id="1153"> However, from Junichiro Koizumi, who was Japan's prime minister 10 years ago, to the present Abe, Japan has repeatedly launched the "sprint" scheme. However, all schemes were abandoned eventually.  </seg>
<seg id="1154"> Yang Bojiang believed that the intension of Japan to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council is be clear at a glance. However, the road is bound to be full of obstacles.  </seg>
<seg id="1155"> To achieve its own goals, Japan should firstly do a good job with the surrounding countries. And Japan needs to have a correct attitude no matter in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute or understanding of a historical problem.  </seg>

<seg id="1197"> Zhang Qi, the Provincial Standing Committee and Sanya Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Wang Lu, vice governor and Lu Zhiyuan, secretary general of provincial government participated in the research seminars.  </seg>
<seg id="1198"> In the 14 years of her sports career, Deng Yaping won a total of 18 world championships, becoming the first Chinese to win four Olympic gold medals in China's Olympic history.  </seg>

<seg id="1201"> Recently, she will work together with Yu Minhong to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform.  </seg>
<seg id="1202"> There was also a team of star coaches in the Chinese sports circle. They were gorgeous in the era of athletes and won countless glory for the country. After retirement, they passed what they learned to the new comers and cultivated a great number of champions.  </seg>
<seg id="1203"> As the first world champion in Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up the pointer after retirement.  </seg>
<seg id="1204"> From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, to the head coach, Huang Yubin created an "Olympic gold group", and led to win 9 gold, 1 silver and 4 copper at the Beijing Olympic Games.  </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Since then, Tian Liang has been experiencing advertising endorsement. He has even served as a "Cowherd", "Lei Feng" and other important roles in recent years.  </seg>
<seg id="1206"> Many NBA players have proved their strength. But whenever there is progress, there is decline.  </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Whether it is because of the increase in age or limited playing time, some players will have regressive performance each season.  </seg>
<seg id="1208"> Of course, some "retreat" may only be data shrink, but the strength of these players may not have been reduced.  </seg>
<seg id="1209"> Even if Wade is still one of the league's best linebacker, his performance in the Bulls is not so good as that of the Heat.  </seg>
<seg id="1210"> The backcourt range of he and Londo is limited. The three-point hit rate of headed star Butler is just 32.8%, making their next-season offence quite challenging.  </seg>
<seg id="1211"> After coming to Feng Cheng, the Red Star will definitely give the ball right to Butler and Rondo and he himself choose to play healthy in the regular season.  </seg>
<seg id="1212"> Okafor's situation is more embarrassing. As the first choice of 76 people last season, he had to compete for playing time and ball right with Simmons and Enby in the new season.  </seg>
<seg id="1213"> This competition may not come soon. Simmons also need to adapt to the NBA stadium, and Enbi must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafor can have a position in the long array of 76 people.  </seg>
<seg id="1214"> Last season, 32% of the score of Okafor comes from the low attack. Such rate is higher than Cousins, Wuchevich and Brook Lopez, while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league.  </seg>
<seg id="1215"> With Simmons already showing a good point-forward potention, Enbi also has a better stature more suitable for NBA games and Okafor's position is hard to be so solid.  </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Over the past two seasons, Thompson's use rate has stabilized in the top 20 of the league and this is the best two seasons for his career.  </seg>
<seg id="1217"> But the problem is, with the arrival of Durant, Thompson's appearance ratio will surely decline, which is bound to affect his play.  </seg>
<seg id="1218"> This effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots, Thompson's holding attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced, which in some ways will reduce the opponent's defense difficulty.  </seg>
<seg id="1219"> Durant's arrival will certainly negatively affect the score of Warriors players, but the one with the most negative effect is probably that of Thompson.  </seg>
<seg id="1220"> But this does not mean that the level of Thompson steps backward. This is more likely that he made sacrifice for the team as a whole.  </seg>
<seg id="1221"> Parker had a better performance than last season. This is not only because his basket efficiency came to the highest level, his chemical reaction with Aldrich also benefits the Spurs.  </seg>
<seg id="1222"> Duncan retired, Ginobili announced a second battles for a year and the combination of GDP eventually came to an end. As one of the youngest among three people, the oil tank of French sports car is not much left.  </seg>
<seg id="1223"> After getting the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular MVP than that of James, while Jordan was the only one who had more FMVP than that of James.  </seg>
<seg id="1224"> Oh, yes, James has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in Cleveland in the past 52 years.  </seg>
<seg id="1225"> Coming to the 14th season of his career, James needs to better conserve his strength and get ready for the playoffs.  </seg>
<seg id="1226"> Therefore, in the regular season, James's capability is likely to further decline, he will give more weight to Owen to bear, but he will still easily become the league's top three players.  </seg>
<seg id="1227"> "I must carry forward what I learned in China to apply to Russia".  </seg>

<seg id="1261"> Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold  </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.  </seg>
<seg id="1263"> Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.  </seg>
<seg id="1264"> Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.  </seg>
<seg id="1265"> The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.  </seg>
<seg id="1266"> But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.  </seg>
<seg id="1267"> It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.  </seg>
<seg id="1268"> It has been some journey for GB.  </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.  </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Here, they lost just one.  </seg>
<seg id="1271"> This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.  </seg>
<seg id="1272"> Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.  </seg>
<seg id="1273"> It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.  </seg>
<seg id="1274"> With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.  </seg>
<seg id="1275"> 12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.  </seg>
<seg id="1276"> A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.  </seg>
<seg id="1277"> On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.  </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.  </seg>
<seg id="1279"> Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.  </seg>
<seg id="1280"> The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.  </seg>
<seg id="1281"> It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.  </seg>
<seg id="1282"> Which is pretty much how it is.  </seg>
<seg id="1283"> GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.  </seg>
<seg id="1284"> Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.  </seg>
<seg id="1285"> It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.  </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.  </seg>
<seg id="1287"> The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.  </seg>
<seg id="1288"> Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.  </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.  </seg>
<seg id="1290"> A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.  </seg>
<seg id="1291"> Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle  </seg>
<seg id="1292"> There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.  </seg>
<seg id="1293"> From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.  </seg>
<seg id="1294"> Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.  </seg>
<seg id="1295"> Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.  </seg>
<seg id="1296"> What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.  </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.  </seg>
<seg id="1298"> As he said, it was touch and go.  </seg>
<seg id="1299"> I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.  </seg>
<seg id="1300"> If they don't it goes everywhere.  </seg>
<seg id="1301"> It would have been a pretty bad situation.  </seg>
<seg id="1302"> It alters your outlook a bit.  </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.  </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.  </seg>
<seg id="1305"> I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.  </seg>
<seg id="1306"> It was an incentive.  </seg>
<seg id="1307"> I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.  </seg>
<seg id="1308"> That's how it starts off.  </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.  </seg>
<seg id="1310"> In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.  </seg>
<seg id="1311"> Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."  </seg>
<seg id="1312"> It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.  </seg>
<seg id="1313"> It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.  </seg>
<seg id="1314"> Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.  </seg>
<seg id="1315"> I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.  </seg>
<seg id="1316"> Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.  </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.  </seg>
<seg id="1318"> Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.  </seg>
<seg id="1319"> We were very much in the moment.  </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.  </seg>
<seg id="1321"> It's really important not to get carried away.  </seg>
<seg id="1322"> We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.  </seg>
<seg id="1323"> We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.  </seg>
<seg id="1324"> The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.  </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.  </seg>
<seg id="1326"> For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.  </seg>
<seg id="1327"> I didn't want to say this was my last race.  </seg>
<seg id="1328"> That would have meant too much pressure.  </seg>
<seg id="1329"> In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.  </seg>
<seg id="1330"> It was all so new and I was so stressed.  </seg>
<seg id="1331"> Here it took about four minutes.  </seg>
<seg id="1332"> This feels so much better," she said.  </seg>

<seg id="1342"> Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.  </seg>
<seg id="1343"> This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.  </seg>
<seg id="1344"> The annual average inflation, measured by CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.  </seg>
<seg id="1345"> The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.  </seg>
<seg id="1346"> The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.  </seg>
<seg id="1347"> In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).  </seg>
<seg id="1348"> Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).  </seg>

<seg id="1350"> Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature  </seg>
<seg id="1351"> Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.  </seg>
<seg id="1352"> With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.  </seg>
<seg id="1353"> You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.  </seg>
<seg id="1354"> The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.  </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Any missteps quickly enter the public record.  </seg>
<seg id="1356"> Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.  </seg>
<seg id="1357"> So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."  </seg>
<seg id="1358"> And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.  </seg>
<seg id="1359"> The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.  </seg>
<seg id="1360"> The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.  </seg>
<seg id="1361"> But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.  </seg>
<seg id="1362"> Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.  </seg>
<seg id="1363"> In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."  </seg>
<seg id="1364"> She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.  </seg>
<seg id="1365"> It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.  </seg>
<seg id="1366"> Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.  </seg>
<seg id="1367"> American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.  </seg>
<seg id="1368"> And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.  </seg>
<seg id="1369"> When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."  </seg>
<seg id="1370"> On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.  </seg>
<seg id="1371"> In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.  </seg>
<seg id="1372"> Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.  </seg>
<seg id="1373"> "It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."  </seg>
<seg id="1374"> Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.  </seg>
<seg id="1375"> The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.  </seg>
<seg id="1376"> On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.  </seg>
<seg id="1377"> For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."  </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says  </seg>
<seg id="1379"> Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.  </seg>
<seg id="1380"> The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.  </seg>
<seg id="1381"> Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.  </seg>
<seg id="1382"> "Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.  </seg>
<seg id="1383"> "What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.  </seg>
<seg id="1384"> The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.  </seg>
<seg id="1385"> The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.  </seg>
<seg id="1386"> Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.  </seg>
<seg id="1387"> "Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.  </seg>
<seg id="1388"> For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.  </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.  </seg>
<seg id="1390"> "After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.  </seg>
<seg id="1391"> From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.  </seg>
<seg id="1392"> Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.  </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.  </seg>
<seg id="1394"> There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.  </seg>
<seg id="1395"> Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.  </seg>
<seg id="1396"> "Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.  </seg>
<seg id="1397"> This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."  </seg>
<seg id="1398"> But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."  </seg>
<seg id="1399"> The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.  </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.  </seg>
<seg id="1401"> Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.  </seg>
<seg id="1402"> But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."  </seg>
<seg id="1403"> The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).  </seg>
<seg id="1404"> But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.  </seg>
<seg id="1405"> The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.  </seg>
<seg id="1406"> Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.  </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.  </seg>
<seg id="1408"> But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.  </seg>
<seg id="1409"> Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.  </seg>
<seg id="1410"> General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.  </seg>
<seg id="1411"> U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain  </seg>
<seg id="1412"> One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.  </seg>
<seg id="1413"> Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.  </seg>
<seg id="1414"> "I have no clue," she said.  </seg>
<seg id="1415"> I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.  </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.  </seg>
<seg id="1417"> Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.  </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.  </seg>
<seg id="1419"> The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.  </seg>
<seg id="1420"> However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.  </seg>
<seg id="1421"> Bam was on that team.  </seg>
<seg id="1422"> She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.  </seg>
<seg id="1423"> She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.  </seg>
<seg id="1424"> Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.  </seg>
<seg id="1425"> The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.  </seg>
<seg id="1426"> "A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.  </seg>
<seg id="1427"> We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.  </seg>
<seg id="1428"> We've made a complete turnaround.  </seg>
<seg id="1429"> On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.  </seg>
<seg id="1430"> India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.  </seg>
<seg id="1431"> She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.  </seg>
<seg id="1432"> Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.  </seg>
<seg id="1433"> The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.  </seg>
<seg id="1434"> She is on a roll.  </seg>
<seg id="1435"> So is Bam.  </seg>
<seg id="1436"> "We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.  </seg>
<seg id="1437"> The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"  </seg>
<seg id="1438"> In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.  </seg>
<seg id="1439"> A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.  </seg>
<seg id="1440"> His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.  </seg>
<seg id="1441"> "It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.  </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."  </seg>
<seg id="1443"> The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.  </seg>
<seg id="1444"> Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."  </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.  </seg>
<seg id="1446"> Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.  </seg>
<seg id="1447"> Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.  </seg>
<seg id="1448"> When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.  </seg>
<seg id="1449"> "Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.  </seg>
<seg id="1450"> There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.  </seg>
<seg id="1451"> They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.  </seg>
<seg id="1452"> Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.  </seg>
<seg id="1453"> Mr. Coe grimaced.  </seg>
<seg id="1454"> "It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.  </seg>
<seg id="1455"> In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.  </seg>
<seg id="1456"> Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  </seg>
<seg id="1457"> It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.  </seg>
<seg id="1458"> "This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.  </seg>
<seg id="1459"> Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.  </seg>
<seg id="1460"> Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.  </seg>
<seg id="1461"> Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.  </seg>
<seg id="1462"> Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.  </seg>
<seg id="1463"> In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.  </seg>
<seg id="1464"> "It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.  </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."  </seg>
<seg id="1466"> Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.  </seg>
<seg id="1467"> It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.  </seg>
<seg id="1468"> As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.  </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.  </seg>
<seg id="1470"> "A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.  </seg>
<seg id="1471"> Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.  </seg>
<seg id="1472"> While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.  </seg>
<seg id="1473"> "He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.  </seg>
<seg id="1474"> He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.  </seg>
<seg id="1475"> He was fabulously out of touch.  </seg>
<seg id="1476"> President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.  </seg>
<seg id="1477"> As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."  </seg>
<seg id="1478"> Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.  </seg>
<seg id="1479"> The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.  </seg>
<seg id="1480"> The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.  </seg>
<seg id="1481"> "She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.  </seg>
<seg id="1482"> Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."  </seg>
<seg id="1483"> There was the cream-puff incident.  </seg>
<seg id="1484"> After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.  </seg>
<seg id="1485"> "It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.  </seg>
<seg id="1486"> There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.  </seg>
<seg id="1487"> Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.  </seg>
<seg id="1488"> Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.  </seg>
<seg id="1489"> Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.  </seg>
<seg id="1490"> Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."  </seg>
<seg id="1491"> Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that the crude oil production in July continued to increase and Saudi Arabia's output hit a new high.  </seg>
<seg id="1492"> The report cannot prevent the market from doubting the credibility of OPEC. Oil recovery path is still bristled with thorns.  </seg>
<seg id="1493"> On Monday, OPEC Chairman and Qatar Energy Minister Sada said OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.  </seg>
<seg id="1494"> The monthly report of OPEC on Wednesday showed that the output of the entire OPEC organization in July, including Gabon, increased by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day.  </seg>
<seg id="1495"> OPEC also said in a monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil, thus increasing the degree of excess supply to the market.  </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Affected by this news, coupled with the production output expectations of rising crude oil and the unexpected increase in crude oil inventories, aggravating the excessive market supply.  </seg>
<seg id="1497"> As of Wednesday's close, the light crude oil futures of New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 2.48% in September and the future price of crude oil in October in London Brent fell by 2.07%.  </seg>
<seg id="1498"> Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to tighten the supply. The data released by US Energy Information Administration also suppress the market sentiment.  </seg>
<seg id="1499"> Iran's official news agency Fars on Wednesday, quoting the speech of Zanganeh, Iranian oil minister, said that Iran's daily crude oil production was up to 3.85 million barrels, which has been the highest level since 2008.  </seg>
<seg id="1500"> At the release of the news of the meeting, the Russian energy minister Novak said that it was unnecessary to conduct a new round of frozen production negotiations under the current oil price.  </seg>
<seg id="1501"> It was April when the oil-producing countries had meeting. No agreement was reached among the OPEC member countries.  </seg>
<seg id="1502"> Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said the market and the media could react excessively to OPEC's meeting.  </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would make an agreement.  </seg>
<seg id="1504"> This means like a smoke and a mirror that draws people's attention (deliberately giving a false impression).  </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Eugen Weinberg, director of commodity research at the German commercial bank, said the possibility of OPEC trying to stabilize the market through the September meeting was low.  </seg>
<seg id="1506"> This is likely to further undermine the market confidence in OPEC. After all, this organization already staged a "wolf is coming".  </seg>
<seg id="1507"> All localities should take medical institutions which have illegal medical advertising, complaints focusing on the past and have repeatedly been punished as a focus of inspection.  </seg>
<seg id="1508"> National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will timely carry out supervision on the supervision and inspection work of some provinces.  </seg>
<seg id="1509"> According to media disclosure, the large influx of capital into the Internet medicine has resulted in the serious problem of current product homogeneity. Investment boom fade gradually and capital came into the wait-and-see period.  </seg>
<seg id="1510"> According to the data of Hong Kong Ai Li Pi Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of start-up Internet medical companies languished just within one year and about 20% of the start-up Internet medical companies has ceased to exist.  </seg>
<seg id="1511"> However, just as the majority of Internet medical companies struggle in the road of A round or B round of financing, several sub-areas leading enterprises can still get the capital touted.  </seg>
<seg id="1512"> It seems that the Internet medical business shall not "swarm", but to see the needs of the market, and be professional and profound.  </seg>
<seg id="1513"> Yuyue invested 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, while Jiuzhoutong invested 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital.  </seg>
<seg id="1514"> In recent years, with the country providing policy support in the medical information, electronic and integrated supply chain management system gradually enter the hospitals at all levels.  </seg>
<seg id="1515"> The cooperation between Yuyue and Jiuzhoutong is aimed at the needs of the market, helping the hospital to build advanced supply chain management system, and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation.  </seg>
<seg id="1516"> Unlike many Internet medical companies which go in for grandiose projects, iBaby focuses on the Internet obstetrics vertical field and be professional on pregnant mothers and doctors.  </seg>
<seg id="1517"> Pregnant women can not only enjoy 24 hours of medical services free of charge and one-on-one inquiry with doctors, but also pay for medical counseling.  </seg>
<seg id="1518"> At the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the geographical restrictions by taking the form of organizing experts to give grassroots doctors an online lecture, peer exchange, case discussion and so on.  </seg>
<seg id="1519"> At present, three plates are set up for doctor's client side, respectively, for doctors to continue education, social exchange and communication.  </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The following services are provided, including online learning, case discussion and academic exchange; social platform for the exchange of doctors of the same hospital and department; legal assistance, business support and other services required by doctor-patient relationship or personal life.  </seg>
<seg id="1521"> According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali health "is willing to get down" to win big health data.  </seg>
<seg id="1522"> Internet companies and data companies are short of professionalism. No unity can be provided on the same entry.  </seg>
<seg id="1523"> The layout of Ali in the medical and health field is divided into three plates, namely, Ali Health, Lynx Pharmacy and Alipay future hospital.  </seg>
<seg id="1524"> Wang Lei admitted that it was more difficult for medical and health companies to start up than other industries, "This is not just how much money you have. In addition, it requires people to be concentrated on it and endure the loneliness.  </seg>
<seg id="1525"> Staying up late watching the Olympic Games will damage the heart easily  </seg>
<seg id="1526"> Brazil Olympic Games is in full swing. Even if the event is broadcast in the midnight in China, many people will stay up late to watch.  </seg>
<seg id="1527"> In this regard, the doctor reminded that staying up late has health risks and may lead to cardiovascular disease.  </seg>
<seg id="1528"> If you stay up for a long time, the hormone will have a lot of secretion and your body will continue to be in a state of intense excitement and cannot have normal recovery. This may easily cause vasoconstriction, blood pressure and thus cardiovascular disease.  </seg>
<seg id="1529"> Han Zhiyuan reminded people who have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood lipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors may easily suffer from cardiovascular disease if staying up late.  </seg>
<seg id="1530"> If you stay up late, then your cardiovascular function will be affected, your gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will also be affected, and even the risk of cancer will increase.  </seg>
<seg id="1531"> For old friends, Han Zhiyuan suggested them better not stay up late to watch games, particularly those with cardiovascular disease.  </seg>
<seg id="1532"> During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Zhiyuan received a 60-year-old patient. His onset of myocardial infarction may be related with staying up late to watch games.  </seg>
<seg id="1533"> According to Han Zhiyuan, his department had treated some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or stroke patients. This is largely due to long-term stay up of patients.  </seg>
<seg id="1534"> 1. Do not stay up late every day. You can occasionally stay up all night watching the favorite sports and watch the rebroadcast for other sports next day.  </seg>
<seg id="1535"> 2. You may drink more water, have more fruit during stay up as this can prevent blood clogging and enhance your body immunity.  </seg>

<seg id="1552"> During the Cold War, the Soviet Union transported the missile into Cuba, which almost led to the US-Soviet nuclear war.  </seg>
<seg id="1553"> This event was seen as the pinnacle of the cold war, known as the "Cuban missile crisis."  </seg>
<seg id="1554"> But what is little known is that during the Cold War, a strong solar storm has almost led to a nuclear war of the United States against the Soviet Union. The incident has not been announced by the researchers until August 9.  </seg>
<seg id="1555"> On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused strong interference to the radar and radio communications of the US military in the Arctic.  </seg>
<seg id="1556"> These radars were part of the ballistic missile early warning system of the US, used for monitoring Soviet missiles.  </seg>
<seg id="1557"> This paper was written by researchers at the University of Colorado, who interviewed US military personnel involved in the forecasting and analysis of solar activity and reviewed non-confidential documents.  </seg>
<seg id="1558"> The paper wrote that in the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly launching nuclear war, the US Air Force has always had some fighters with nuclear warheads flying in the sky.  </seg>
<seg id="1559"> US military commanders did not know that the culprit of the interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, so they ordered the fighters to enter combat readiness state.  </seg>
<seg id="1560"> Fortunately, the US military force had started the study of solar activities and its electromagnetic interference to the Earth since the 1950s, it ultimately stopped this potential military conflict.  </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Later, he summarized the information provided by the US Air Force Air Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report.  </seg>
<seg id="1562"> The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the US military has seen space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecast system.  </seg>
<seg id="1563"> During daily travel, when citizens found that their cars were hampered by a strange vehicle, they may use "WeChat vehicle moving" function to solve this problem when they failed to contact with the strange vehicle driver.  </seg>

<seg id="1594"> On the national fitness day, Nanluo Maying Sports Culture Park, outside the Hangzhou Wangjiang gate, unveiled its mysterious veil.  </seg>
<seg id="1595"> It was a coal field once and remained idle for more than 10 years after its closure. A large number of illegal construction and garbage were left behind.  </seg>
<seg id="1596"> After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened in November to the public free of charge to provide sports venues. In addition, it would undoubtedly open up a new fertile soil for the whole people.  </seg>

<seg id="1605"> Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck  </seg>
<seg id="1606"> Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.  </seg>
<seg id="1607"> In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.  </seg>
<seg id="1608"> In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.  </seg>
<seg id="1609"> Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.  </seg>
<seg id="1610"> The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.  </seg>

<seg id="1617"> Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.  </seg>
<seg id="1618"> In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.  </seg>

<seg id="1621"> "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.  </seg>
<seg id="1622"> In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.  </seg>
<seg id="1623"> It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.  </seg>
<seg id="1624"> Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.  </seg>
<seg id="1625"> "Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.  </seg>
<seg id="1626"> On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.  </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.  </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.  </seg>
<seg id="1629"> On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.  </seg>
<seg id="1630"> "He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.  </seg>
<seg id="1631"> Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.  </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.  </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.  </seg>
<seg id="1634"> President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.  </seg>
<seg id="1635"> At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.  </seg>
<seg id="1636"> Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.  </seg>
<seg id="1637"> Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.  </seg>
<seg id="1638"> The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.  </seg>
<seg id="1639"> The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.  </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.  </seg>

<seg id="1642"> Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News  </seg>
<seg id="1643"> A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.  </seg>
<seg id="1644"> Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.  </seg>
<seg id="1645"> During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.  </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.  </seg>
<seg id="1647"> How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?  </seg>
<seg id="1648"> Lanzmann wrote.  </seg>
<seg id="1649"> Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.  </seg>
<seg id="1650"> Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.  </seg>
<seg id="1651"> The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."  </seg>
<seg id="1652"> The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."  </seg>
<seg id="1653"> The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.  </seg>
<seg id="1654"> "The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.  </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.  </seg>
<seg id="1656"> We were appalled and shocked by the incident.  </seg>
<seg id="1657"> It is in itself a great shame.  </seg>
<seg id="1658"> The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.  </seg>
<seg id="1659"> That needs no explanation.  </seg>
<seg id="1660"> We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.  </seg>
<seg id="1661"> The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.  </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.  </seg>
<seg id="1663"> "Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.  </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.  </seg>
<seg id="1665"> "There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.  </seg>
<seg id="1666"> It adds that the code was now added.  </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students  </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.  </seg>
<seg id="1669"> Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.  </seg>
<seg id="1670"> The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.  </seg>
<seg id="1671"> Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.  </seg>
<seg id="1672"> Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.  </seg>
<seg id="1673"> Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.  </seg>
<seg id="1674"> This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.  </seg>
<seg id="1675"> Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold  </seg>
<seg id="1676"> Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.  </seg>
<seg id="1677"> The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.  </seg>
<seg id="1678"> Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.  </seg>
<seg id="1679"> And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.  </seg>
<seg id="1680"> The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.  </seg>
<seg id="1681"> They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.  </seg>
<seg id="1682"> Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.  </seg>
<seg id="1683"> Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.  </seg>
<seg id="1684"> Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.  </seg>
<seg id="1685"> And the British trio won the duel for gold.  </seg>
<seg id="1686"> Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.  </seg>
<seg id="1687"> A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.  </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.  </seg>
<seg id="1689"> The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."  </seg>
<seg id="1690"> I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.  </seg>
<seg id="1691"> We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.  </seg>
<seg id="1692"> It was just incredible.  </seg>
<seg id="1693"> There's no better way to win it.  </seg>
<seg id="1694"> After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.  </seg>
<seg id="1695"> He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.  </seg>
<seg id="1696"> There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.  </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."  </seg>
<seg id="1698"> We all as a team came together in the last three months.  </seg>
<seg id="1699"> We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.  </seg>
<seg id="1700"> That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.  </seg>
<seg id="1701"> If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.  </seg>
<seg id="1702"> With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.  </seg>
<seg id="1703"> That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.  </seg>
<seg id="1704"> That would be the same as Hoy's.  </seg>
<seg id="1705"> Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.  </seg>
<seg id="1706"> The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.  </seg>
<seg id="1707"> The team event is always the best.  </seg>
<seg id="1708"> You get to win it with your mates.  </seg>
<seg id="1709"> It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.  </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."  </seg>
<seg id="1711"> It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.  </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.  </seg>
<seg id="1713"> They finished in 3:51.943.  </seg>
<seg id="1714"> The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.  </seg>
<seg id="1715"> The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.  </seg>
<seg id="1716"> He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.  </seg>
<seg id="1717"> In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.  </seg>
<seg id="1718"> Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.  </seg>
<seg id="1719"> After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.  </seg>
<seg id="1720"> There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.  </seg>
<seg id="1721"> However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.  </seg>
<seg id="1722"> After the little baby came to this world, Mom and Dad shall be responsible for his life, not only for his health, but also for the development of his spirit, that is, education.  </seg>
<seg id="1723"> If such education failed, then no matter how successful your career is, you cannot make up for the shortcomings of life and family failure.  </seg>
<seg id="1724"> When a new baby is born, the new dad and mom need to spend time in taking care of and educating him, and be responsible for him.  </seg>
<seg id="1725"> And responsibility is not only reflected in the care of body, making them healthy, but also the education of spirit. That is, to make children learn how to behave, grow up and succeed.  </seg>
<seg id="1726"> Good family education means that parents often need to accompany their children, to take care of them patiently and teach them develop a civilized behavior and make them learn knowledge better and enhance intelligence.  </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Parents' words and deeds will affect the growth of their children because they will imitate their parents. And that is the so called, "like father, like son". Your son will be the same as you.  </seg>
<seg id="1728"> So we need to be a good example in front of children, regulate our words, cultivate our characters, which will indirectly help children shape their own excellent character, so that he will become more excellent.  </seg>

<seg id="1731"> But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she cannot concentrate long on what she wants to do and works on.  </seg>
<seg id="1732"> This secret is accompanied by Amy for a long time. Usually the problem is not serious.  </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Even though she learns and works in decentralized, modular, she can complete the task basically, and achieve good results.  </seg>
<seg id="1734"> However, when the task is heavy and pressing, Amy feels very painful and tortured.  </seg>
<seg id="1735"> The individual's resistance to self-exposure and his emotional experience is to prevent the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from threatening.  </seg>
<seg id="1736"> And some behaviorist psychologists understand the impedance as an individual's disobedience to their behavioral corrections.  </seg>
<seg id="1737"> I tried to let Amy do an exercise, let her breathe through the way to calm down and feel the torment.  </seg>

<seg id="1756"> The head of the Department of Industrial Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission said that iron and steel overcapacity is now a global problem.  </seg>
<seg id="1757"> China's capacity utilization in recent years is higher than the global average, but also higher than that of the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.  </seg>
<seg id="1758"> China has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.  </seg>
<seg id="1759"> The official pointed out that the CPC Central Committee and State Council should attach great importance to the global problem of iron and steel overcapacity.  </seg>
<seg id="1760"> All departments and regions should actively implement the deployment of the State Council, earnestly carry out the work, and reduce crude steel production capacity by 45 million tons this year.  </seg>
<seg id="1761"> From China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it also takes a series of practical measures to control steel exports.  </seg>
<seg id="1762"> The person in charge stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially a market behavior and an independent choice from the requirement of importing countries and after considering the product cost and other factors.  </seg>
<seg id="1763"> The implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the global steel industry development issues. On the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order.  </seg>
<seg id="1764"> When it comes to debt, the person in charge stressed that the resolution of the debt problem is to properly handle the important issues that need proper handling.  </seg>
<seg id="1765"> As the iron and steel enterprises are large-scale and involve a wide range of enterprises, the debt relationship is complex. It may lead to regional risks if disposed of improperly.  </seg>
<seg id="1766"> According to the person in charge, in recent years, with the economic downward pressure to increase, the total social demand gradually weakened, part of the industry capacity utilization decreased and enterprise production and management difficulties increased.  </seg>
<seg id="1767"> Some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment and the production and management is difficult to sustain or even on the brink of collapse. But restrained by some institutional factors, they become "zombie enterprises" due to many obstacles to the market.  </seg>
<seg id="1768"> The existence of these companies distorted market signal, reduced the elements resources use efficiency, increased the cost of social management, thereby hindering the establishment of market environment with fair competition.  </seg>
<seg id="1769"> The main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utilization rate.  </seg>
<seg id="1770"> China mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is mainly to do the work of disclosing the ins and outs to workers and social stability, to ensure fair and equitable market order.  </seg>
<seg id="1771"> The person in charge stressed that the next step is to do a good job to ensure overcapacity cutting and ensuring the objective of resolving 100 million tons-150 million tons of crude steel production capacity within five years.  </seg>

<seg id="1792"> For the conditions of applying for residence permit, the above regions generally said that the applicants need to live more than six months and meet one of these three requirements: having legitimate and stable employment, having legal and stable residence and continuous study.  </seg>
<seg id="1793"> Chinanews journalist noted that in the aspect of residence permit providing treatment, the "gold content" is different in various cities. Compared with the national provisions, some areas have provided more public services and conveniences.  </seg>
<seg id="1794"> These areas have increased the conveniences of children to attend college entrance examination in the local place while meeting the related requirement.  </seg>
<seg id="1795"> In addition, it is clearly proposed by Beijing and other places that they will gradually expand the scope of public services and convenience, and regularly release to the community.  </seg>
<seg id="1796"> For example, Fujian proposed to announce the public services and convenience of residence permit holders to the public at least every 3 years  </seg>
<seg id="1797"> "Residence Permit Provisional Regulations" provides that, for those in line with the residence permit conditions, the public security organs shall issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance.  </seg>
<seg id="1798"> For the time limit, most of the region hold the same opinion with the national version. That is, to release the permit within 15 days.  </seg>
<seg id="1799"> Hebei clearly stipulates that for applicants who meet the conditions of application and have complete application documents, the residence police station shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of acceptance.  </seg>

<seg id="1815"> In the first half, Salic showed his capability of drawing space on the scene. He can have a shot outside the three-point line via the pick and roll with his colleagues.  </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Although the current 76-team is packed with many gifted young players, they are not equipped with the outside scoring capability as Salic.  </seg>
<seg id="1817"> From block shot to launching a long pass, fast break and complete assists, there are just a few insiders who can do it on the NBA game.  </seg>
<seg id="1818"> Since the beginning of this Olympic Games, Salic has obtained 13 points, eight backboards and five assists in three games, with a full performance.  </seg>
<seg id="1819"> James has signed two 1 + 1 contracts since he decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.  </seg>
<seg id="1820"> Now, as this labor agreement is about to enter the last year, James will be in the forefront of labor negotiations as the vice chairman of NBA player union.  </seg>
<seg id="1821"> The substantial increase in union revenue is attributed to the new television protocol. The question is how the boss and players deal with the money. The outside world is worried that the NBA will fall in the next summer.  </seg>
<seg id="1822"> But for James, he will not have to worry that he will become a free agent next summer because he has renewed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers.  </seg>
<seg id="1823"> No matter when the 2017-18 season kicks off, James is within the contract.  </seg>
<seg id="1824"> Since the stunning debut of iPhoneSE, the mobile phone market also ushered in a small screen machine boom.  </seg>
<seg id="1825"> Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first works of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.  </seg>
<seg id="1826"> NubiaZ11mini follows its consistent photographed gene, and is equipped with a one-hand easier-to-hold 5.0-inch screen, portable and convenient post-fingerprint recognition, contributing to its superior experience.  </seg>
<seg id="1827"> A small screen camera phone Z11mini, which was just listed by Nubia, had a price fall of RMB 200, decreasing from the original RMB 1499 to RMB 1299.  </seg>
<seg id="1828"> In appearance, nubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen. The classic "little red circle" design is below on the front side.  </seg>
<seg id="1829"> The middle frame is metal material. Its bottom adopts symmetrical design and is equipped with Type-C data interface.  </seg>
<seg id="1830"> Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract  </seg>
<seg id="1831"> The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.  </seg>
<seg id="1832"> The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.  </seg>
<seg id="1833"> A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.  </seg>
<seg id="1834"> Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.  </seg>
<seg id="1835"> As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.  </seg>
<seg id="1836"> And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.  </seg>
<seg id="1837"> In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.  </seg>
<seg id="1838"> Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.  </seg>
<seg id="1839"> The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.  </seg>
<seg id="1840"> AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.  </seg>
<seg id="1841"> The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.  </seg>
<seg id="1842"> "AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.  </seg>
<seg id="1843"> AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.  </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.  </seg>
<seg id="1845"> "As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.  </seg>
<seg id="1846"> Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.  </seg>
<seg id="1847"> AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."  </seg>
<seg id="1848"> Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."  </seg>
<seg id="1849"> The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.  </seg>
<seg id="1850"> Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.  </seg>
<seg id="1851"> Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.  </seg>
<seg id="1852"> If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.  </seg>
<seg id="1853"> And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.  </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year  </seg>
<seg id="1855"> More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.  </seg>
<seg id="1856"> In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.  </seg>
<seg id="1857"> Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.  </seg>
<seg id="1858"> From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.  </seg>
<seg id="1859"> Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.  </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.  </seg>
<seg id="1861"> "Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.  </seg>
<seg id="1862"> People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.  </seg>
<seg id="1863"> The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.  </seg>
<seg id="1864"> We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.  </seg>
<seg id="1865"> Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.  </seg>
<seg id="1866"> It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.  </seg>
<seg id="1867"> Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun  </seg>
<seg id="1868"> New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.  </seg>
<seg id="1869"> The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.  </seg>
<seg id="1870"> Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."  </seg>
<seg id="1871"> The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.  </seg>
<seg id="1872"> After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.  </seg>
<seg id="1873"> "Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.  </seg>
<seg id="1874"> The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.  </seg>
<seg id="1875"> Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.  </seg>
<seg id="1876"> Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.  </seg>
<seg id="1877"> Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.  </seg>
<seg id="1878"> Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.  </seg>
<seg id="1879"> WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.  </seg>
<seg id="1880"> A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.  </seg>
<seg id="1881"> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.  </seg>
<seg id="1882"> The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).  </seg>
<seg id="1883"> Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow  </seg>
<seg id="1884"> Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.  </seg>
<seg id="1885"> For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.  </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.  </seg>
<seg id="1887"> And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.  </seg>
<seg id="1888"> For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.  </seg>
<seg id="1889"> Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.  </seg>
<seg id="1890"> I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.  </seg>
<seg id="1891"> The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.  </seg>
<seg id="1892"> There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.  </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.  </seg>
<seg id="1894"> Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.  </seg>
<seg id="1895"> We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.  </seg>
<seg id="1896"> Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.  </seg>
<seg id="1897"> The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.  </seg>
<seg id="1898"> It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.  </seg>
<seg id="1899"> Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury  </seg>
<seg id="1900"> Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide  </seg>
<seg id="1901"> The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.  </seg>
<seg id="1902"> Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.  </seg>
<seg id="1903"> The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.  </seg>
<seg id="1904"> A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.  </seg>
<seg id="1905"> Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.  </seg>
<seg id="1906"> She died at the scene.  </seg>
<seg id="1907"> Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.  </seg>
<seg id="1908"> A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.  </seg>
<seg id="1909"> However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.  </seg>
<seg id="1910"> Was it possible to avoid impact?  </seg>
<seg id="1911"> That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.  </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.  </seg>
<seg id="1913"> In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.  </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.  </seg>
<seg id="1915"> The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.  </seg>
<seg id="1916"> The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.  </seg>
<seg id="1917"> Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.  </seg>
<seg id="1918"> NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable  </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.  </seg>
<seg id="1920"> Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.  </seg>
<seg id="1921"> The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.  </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.  </seg>
<seg id="1923"> But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.  </seg>
<seg id="1924"> The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.  </seg>
<seg id="1925"> The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.  </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.  </seg>
<seg id="1927"> "In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.  </seg>
<seg id="1928"> This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.  </seg>
<seg id="1929"> The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.  </seg>
<seg id="1930"> The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.  </seg>
<seg id="1931"> Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.  </seg>
<seg id="1932"> Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.  </seg>
<seg id="1933"> As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.  </seg>
<seg id="1934"> Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.  </seg>
<seg id="1935"> Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach  </seg>
<seg id="1936"> Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.  </seg>
<seg id="1937"> Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.  </seg>
<seg id="1938"> "For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.  </seg>
<seg id="1939"> I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.  </seg>
<seg id="1940"> To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.  </seg>
<seg id="1941"> He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.  </seg>
<seg id="1942"> These conditions are not currently met.  </seg>
<seg id="1943"> Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.  </seg>
<seg id="1944"> "Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.  </seg>
<seg id="1945"> We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.  </seg>
<seg id="1946"> Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.  </seg>
<seg id="1947"> He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.  </seg>
<seg id="1948"> The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.  </seg>
<seg id="1949"> A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.  </seg>
<seg id="1950"> North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike  </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.  </seg>
<seg id="1952"> Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.  </seg>
<seg id="1953"> "Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.  </seg>
<seg id="1954"> We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.  </seg>
<seg id="1955"> The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.  </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.  </seg>
<seg id="1957"> The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.  </seg>
<seg id="1958"> The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.  </seg>
<seg id="1959"> Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.  </seg>
<seg id="1960"> Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.  </seg>
<seg id="1961"> Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.  </seg>
<seg id="1962"> The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.  </seg>
<seg id="1963"> "In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.  </seg>
<seg id="1964"> Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.  </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster  </seg>
<seg id="1966"> The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.  </seg>
<seg id="1967"> The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.  </seg>
<seg id="1968"> "We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.  </seg>
<seg id="1969"> The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.  </seg>
<seg id="1970"> Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.  </seg>
<seg id="1971"> They're spinning as fast as they ever will.  </seg>
<seg id="1972"> At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.  </seg>
<seg id="1973"> As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.  </seg>
<seg id="1974"> As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.  </seg>
<seg id="1975"> Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.  </seg>
<seg id="1976"> The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.  </seg>
<seg id="1977"> Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.  </seg>
<seg id="1978"> "In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.  </seg>
<seg id="1979"> Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.  </seg>
<seg id="1980"> "The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.  </seg>
<seg id="1981"> We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.  </seg>
<seg id="1982"> Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.  </seg>
<seg id="1983"> According to Zheng Jianjun, the Management Section Chief of Nanhu Park Water Area, the deepest point of the South Lake is more than 10 meters deep. People who do not understand the situation of water are probably confronted with danger.  </seg>
<seg id="1984"> "Although the Nanhu Park rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the majority of rowing tourists can wear life jackets and stay away from illegal activities on the lake to play safely" Zheng Jianjun said.  </seg>
<seg id="1985"> Wai Tau Tsuen boasts a unique marine environment, with two leisure travel resources including natural ecology and cultural ecology.  </seg>
<seg id="1986"> "However, several owners who bought the parking spaces in the community feared that this would affect the price of their parking spaces and doubted that others were selfish, so they had been plotting for bad things. This had shelved the parking space transformation. "  </seg>
<seg id="1987"> As for the question about when the sweet potatoes are introduced and by whom, there are still many different versions in the academic community.  </seg>
<seg id="1988"> In the current mainstream view, there are three major lines for the introduction of sweet potato.  </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Among the three lines of introducing sweet potato, the introduction by Chen Zhenlong from Philippine to Fuzhou is the one with the greatest impact and largest communication.  </seg>
<seg id="1990"> Beijing Municipal Social Management Office will soon carry out special inspections on the use of unified receipts of social group membership fees.  </seg>
<seg id="1991"> Inspection is divided into two categories, unit self-examination and spot inspection.  </seg>
<seg id="1992"> Relevant person in charge of the municipal association said, the scope of the inspection covers social groups who received unified receipts of social group fees in the social mass organization between 2013 and 2015.  </seg>
<seg id="1993"> "The success of the Olympic Games is defined by people who share stories in social media," said the Rio Olympic Organizing Committee while establishing the communication strategy of 2012 Olympic Games.  </seg>
<seg id="1994"> From the news reports of the Olympic Games, all media have made a lot of changes in the aspect of mode of transmission, product form, language style, news perspective and many other aspects.  </seg>
<seg id="1995"> It seems that the International Olympic Committee and the media practitioners around the world will have to meet this round of challenges.  </seg>
<seg id="1996"> On August 11, this is the last day for the open sale of Everbright Securities H shares. News went that the market response was not special for market of the previous two days. According to the plan, it will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.  </seg>
<seg id="1997"> A domestic brokerage analyst said that the Orient Securities in Hong Kong did not enjoy a good foundation. Only its capital management business is its strength. It has many inherent problems compared with Bank of China International and CITIC Securities, etc.  </seg>
<seg id="1998"> Experts pointed out that with the return of the securities market to flatness, many brokers sagged this year in results. But the detailed situation of the listed companies is dependent on the detailed development of the corporate business and cannot be generalized.  </seg>
<seg id="1999"> After the introduction of the regulation of the new deal, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city to restart the purchase restriction.  </seg>
<seg id="2000"> In addition to Suzhou, other second-tier cities including Hefei and Nanjing will also introduce the property market regulation and control policies.  </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Prior to this, Hefei has been the first to issue restrictions on lending policy. For people who have two suites in Hefei and have one housing loan not paid, they will be denied with the mortgage services from bank.  </seg>
